The apartment was very comfortable and I really enjoyed having the park with running path across the street. The only downside was it wasn't within walking distance to restaurants, bars, or coffee shops. But they are a short drive away. Overall, great stay!",en

THe location was perfect ; 5 minutes walk to studio, beach and awsome food market.Dangerous place for shoppers as some of the shops near her house are amazing! Also it is so close to some of the best raw or healthy restaurants or whole foods markets.  REv. Dr. Louise  took care of me like a daughter and she and I are friends forever now. The best sleep I have ever had surrounded by healing crystals and plants that facilitated so much healing and space for my life to unfold on this Yoga journey.

2732,1515377,2012-06-19,2248831,Eric,"I had an absolutely fantastic stay with Rev. Dr. Louise-Diana. Her hospitality, kindness, conversations, and helpful information made me feel welcome in her home. The location was excellent it is near everything, from the 3rd Street Promenade to Venice Beach or even the Santa Monica Pier; all the sites are close by. I highly recommend staying with the good Dr. if you’re visiting the Santa Monica area. ",en

2732,1979159,2012-08-13,2295610,Rebecca,"Louise-Diana was nice and her apartment is in an awesome location (I used to live 3 blocks away yrs ago). However, the pull out love seat bed was unbearable. I canceled my stay the next day and got refunded after sending in photos of the mattress. It's a cheap love seat, maybe 15 yrs old, with metal bars poking your back through the 2 inch, cheap mattress. Fabric is torn in many places as with the matching furniture. I got 3 uneasy hours of sleep. The apartment is also quite dated, stuffy, and not as nice as the photos and word 'townhouse' seem to impart. I'd charge a bit less for it. Otherwise I'd rate the rest as fair to good. Louise-Diana is cheerful and easy going. With a new bed, she'll be in much better shape. I LOVED my 1st 2 AirBnB experiences in Italy, this makes me more careful when choosing, and I'll avoid pull-out couches!",en

Her apartment is beautiful -- she has a beautiful garden right beside the sofa.  Her apartment is a few blocks from the beach, the farm market -- and great shops.

The location was absolutely perfect with the beach just a couple of blocks away, a grocery store to a walking distance, cafes, restaurants and trendy stores just around the corner. Rev-Dr. Louise Diana was very kind, welcoming and sweet. She was very nice to be around and a very thoughtful host. I will definitely stay here when I´m back in Santa Monica! :)",en

In ten minutes you are on the beach. From the moment I arrived I felt welcome and at ease. Louise Diana is the perfect host. She respects your space but if ever you need anything she is eager and happy to assist. Will defiantly be staying here if I return to Santa Monica. ",en

2732,52399662,2015-10-29,9228059,Rainbow,"Louise-Diana was kind and accommodating. She'll be there when you arrive, introduce the neighborhood, and make sure you get settled in nicely. If you're lucky you might even get to explore some of the city with her as she's very well connected. The downstairs has great natural lighting and is spacious and comfortable. If you want to get up with the sunrise, you would love this place. Most importantly, this quaint little townhouse is in a prime location - less than 10 minutes' walk from the beach, 15 minutes to the closest grocery store, and 15 minutes to hip boutiques and restaurants on Main Street. There are very few streetlights in this area, though, so you'll want to take caution after dark. Other things to note: There is no air conditioning, fan or heater, and no shelf or wardrobe for storage. Furniture is worn from natural wear and tear and sun exposure over the years. The washer and dryer are in another room several doors down and you'll need to pay to do laundry. You'll also need to buy your own toilet paper and scrub down the bathroom before you leave. It is important to keep clean and organized and ask questions, as Louise-Diana is very particular about how she keeps things and how you take care of her home. But overall, you'll be sharing a space with a wonderfully experienced woman who has some amazing stories to tell, you'll be living in a quiet neighborhood while still being walking distance away from the hustle and bustle, and you'll be able to have an easy, secluded space to rest when you want to relax in the evenings.",en
2732,83284545,2016-07-02,8240550,Yigal,"First about the hostess.  Louise-Diana is an exceptional hostess.  She's a very gracious, considerate, unique, fun, and well educated energetic powerhouse but at the same time she provides a relaxing environment, in my mind closely analogous to the city of Santa Monica as a whole.  The home is really quintessential Santa Monica living.  Very serene, relaxing, beach, health conscious living that pushes up against a passionate drive for excellence in the quality of life from food to education, the arts and etc..   This aptly describes both her home and Santa Monica as a whole.  For me as I'm starting a new chapter in my life the gestalt of Reverand Dr. Louise-Diana, her supportive energetic presence, her peaceful well functioning home and Santa Monica as a whole was a real transformative opportunity.If you get the chance to live here you'll certainly be making the right decision.-Yigal",en

The position is grate and even if it’s not a private room, if you’re traveling it’s a good place to stay with a private bathroom. You will enjoy the Santa Monica experience and you can ask the host what kind of nice activities are around the area! She is a really particular person so I wouldn’t recommend it for long period like many months where you have to feel “home”.",en
2732,582821999,2019-12-27,193454295,David,"I enjoyed my stay as I was there for 2 months. I’m in outside sales so I traveled a lot and wasn’t there much during the week. But when I was, it was clean and the outside area was my favorite part of the location. The bed is an air mattress which I wasn’t aware of, but it is comfortable nonetheless. Location is the best part in my opinion. Earlymorning runs on the beach is easily accessible. This was my first 2 months in California and she helped me feel comfortable as it was a bit of a culture shock coming from Michigan. I wish her the best.",en
3021,7010448,2013-09-03,7008708,Kim,"I've lived in Los Angeles for 23 years. My favorite time was the 10 years I lived in Laurel Canyon, so when I recently sold my home and needed a place to stay for a month before moving out of state, I naturally wanted to return there. Nataraj's place is just lovely...well designed, peaceful, completely private and has everything you could possibly need. It's centrally located and convenient to both Hollywood and the Valley. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. For out-of-state visitors, you should know that you'll need a car to get anywhere. And cell phone signals in the hills are tricky, but Nataraj can talk you thru ways around that. Parking is a little hard to find when kids are being dropped off or picked up at the school down the hill...or late on a Saturday night. But the walk up and down the hill is fun with lots of interesting houses to look at. And my dog really enjoyed all the nature.Nataraj is charming and handles any and all situations as they come up. The apartment is below his house so you occasionally hear people walking and talking upstairs, but it was quiet 99% of the time. I would recommend this guesthouse (Website hidden by Airbnb) a great Los Angeles/Laurel Canyon experience!",en

3021,97187443,2016-08-26,89217499,Laila,"The guest house was in an amazing location, although keep in mind the traffic throughout the day can get bad especially when the elementary school at the end of the street is out. I booked the air BnB over a week before my stay, when booking I noticed that there was no check in time.  I had been messaging Nataraj while booking, but as soon as I asked when check in was, I received no response until the day before my stay.  I landed at 9am and found out that I could not check in till 6pm that evening, I did make it work but I was very upset that I still paid for the full day and night. As for the guest house we loved the set up and the look of it (at first glance) Nataraj definitely has good taste.  If you are not a fan of spiders/spider webs and bugs, this is not the place for you, they were everywhere. The lighting through the guest house is horrible so if you're a girl and need good lighting to get ready this is going to be a problem, along with the fact that there is only one small mirror in the bedroom and the mirror in the bathroom.   Nataraj says he has AC in the house that's connected to the main house but keep in mind this AC vent is TINY and it gets way too hot, he does have a fan in there but it did no good. Even having all the windows open it still did not help much, speaking of Windows some of them did not work well when opening and closing, they did not have blinds/curtains so we had to tape up some paper towels To have privacy in the restroom. If you plan on wearing heels the walk up and down to the guest house is difficult, it was a mission leaving everyday and trying to keep our balance.  If you plan on staying with multiple people and going out also keep in mind Nataraj wants it very quiet. As for the air BnB I loved the location and nataraj taste in decor but I would not return unless the AC, lighting, and cleanliness is approved on.  As for Nataraj we had very little contact but he was very nice and accomdated us when we needed extra bedding.",en

I felt that this was important to preface because my intention is never to just leave a negative review our of spite. Sadly, my experience with this apartment was not great. It is a nice little spot in the canyon & owner is prompt to reply during the booking process. I booked this place for my mother and grandmother for the holidays and it was delivered in less than acceptable condition. I have certain expectations of cleanliness when staying in hotels or rentals. There are fees that us as renters pay for cleaning, so I don't expect anything less than super clean space that we feel safe and comfortable in. Sadly my mom and grandma (who was a house keeper for 20+ years) found a place nothing like what we expected. When I picked up the keys at 7pm before getting my family from the airport, I ran into the owners tenant from an upstairs apartment cleaning the space. I thought nothing of it at the time. I dropped off my mom and gram at 11pm and it wasn't until the early morning heard of the conditions that they had to sleep in and immediately made them leave (They felt bad and guilty to complain to me in the middle of the night). I reached out to the owner at 9 AM and didn't hear back until 4pm. It wasn't until 6PM that he did a walk through the space to alert me that the stove was was dirty but other than that he didn't agree with my assessment. He did offer to clean that and have us check back in, but it was clear that we do not have the same idea of what clean is. My mom took photos of all the issues and if the owner didn't seem to notice anything like the mess in the bathroom shelf unacceptable for a paying client, dirty fridge and microwave, dirty floor with some bug traps and bugs in corners. Again, we are not friends crashing at his place for free. We are paying clients. I didn't want to spend the little time I have with my family giving the host directions on what he needs to clean after he didn't accept my offer to send him photos. Every time someone leaves a hosts place, the place should be mopped, dusted, bleached and completely cleaned for the next guests. It's an issue of integrity and hygiene. In all my experiences with AirBnB, I know that owners hire actual cleaning crews to take advantage of the cleaning fee to do the actual cleaning. No questions asked! I am hopeful that my experience and feedback will encourage the host to take appropriate actions to ensure that cleanliness in his nice apartment is never again an issue. I booked the stay based on previous good reviews so I am sure...",en

Uber rides out of the canyon are not expensive and easy to come by. Very quiet. Nataraj is a good host. Meets you in person, and was very accommodating with our late check in request.

3021,343487497,2018-10-31,166061150,Rebecca,"My friend and I stayed here for about a month and a half while we were transitioning between apartments. Overall--we had a pleasant experience. The design and decor of the guesthouse was very aesthetically pleasing and it was obvious that the host put in a lot of effort. It was stocked full with kitchen supplies, there was a decently sized closet, and a very nice TV with full cable access. Here are a few things worth noting: -Be prepared for street parking the majority of the time. In general it was not hard to find very close parking, but there were a few times (usually a night after residents are back from work) that we spent up to 20 minutes trying to find parking/walking back and forth from the cars to the apartment. There technically is a spot on the sidewalk that guests could use, but the host's car was there 98% of the time.-There is a part of the floor of the guesthouse that exposes the structural foundation (basically 2ft deep inserts with dirt/rocks at the bottom). I believe the host has an intention of putting glass over the openings, but for the entirety of our stay they were uncovered. As a consequence, we noticed that there was an above normal amount of spiders and bugs that were getting into the apartment. So if you have an issue with little bugs, keep this in mind. Furthermore, this might not be the best idea for guests with crawling babies and young children, because it could be very easy for them to slip. -There is basically no cellphone service/data roaming in the surrounding area. There is wifi at the guesthouse, but it is mediocre at best due to the general lack of reception. The issue of cell phone service can be solved with wifi calling, but that is only if you are directly inside the guesthouse. If you are going to require extremely reliable internet services/communication services during your stay, this might not be the best option. These are just little things that we noticed as a result of staying at the guesthouse for an extended period of time, but they did not detract greatly from our overall experience.",en

The one thing I have to mention is that for work travelers the internet is very slow, so much so that it will be hard to work if you are a software engineer.  It barely has enough bandwidth to stream a video.  So this place didn't work out for me given the internet situation.

It’s also wonderfully quiet, with a killer shower and a hot tub that I used most evenings and felt it was private as no one else was ever there.

The bed was super comfy and the collection of books had something for everyone. And you have your own parking spot. What else could you want?

The Craftsman Duplex is a great space full of charm and character (and bigger than we were expecting!) and the fantastic location cant be beat. Its less than 20 minutes walking distance to Franklin Village (The Oaks Gourmet, Birds, La Poubelle) and many other restaurants, bars, and shops like Hollywood Blvd & The Theatre District, Franklin/Argyle intersection, etc. You are also a short walk to the Metro stop at the W Hotel which can get you to The Valley or Downtown LA quickly. And, the Duplex is in the midst of wonderful streets to wander around in one of the best neighborhoods in Los Angeles (Beachwood Canyon, The Hollywood Dell, Bronson Canyon). There is a lot to offer without the use of a car, which is always a nice perk while in Los Angeles. However, if you do want to venture out via car, you have easy access to Los Feliz, Hollywood, Miracle Mile, Beverly Hills. We enjoyed chatting with Suzan and Michael when we saw them and were impressed with what they had done to the space. The Craftsman Duplex is truly a wonderful option for anyone's stay in Los Angeles, whether its a short trip or a longer holiday. Highly recommend and we cant wait to stay there again.

However, the problem stems mainly from the fact that her accommodations were not what was described on the Airbnb webpage.  Sandra had recently moved from her previous residence, which was portrayed as a “charming1bd/1bth in Brentwood” to a small residence south of Santa Monica Blvd.  Sandra was surprised to learn that the posting had not been updated. Because of the lack of available closet space and accommodations in general, her current place is not well suited for older couples (like us) for a week’s stay.

Lois and Craig live in the back house where they also rent out rooms to different guests. The two houses are very close so you hear people going in and out quite often - not much privacy there. Though on the other hand they can resolve issues for you right away if they are there. We had problems with the refrigerator being too cold and the electricity overloading easily (e.g.we couldn’t use more than one kitchen appliance at the same time). Lois and Craig did try to help us in any way they can. Also do note that air conditioning is only available in the bedrooms, not the common areas. The information on the listing may be a little misleading. In the summer it does get quite hot so keep that in mind. And the washer/dryer units are in a separate room and shared by the host and their other guests. I remember being disgusted by the prior user for not getting rid of the sand in their clothes before putting them in the machine. The kitchen utensils, mugs, plates had some cleanliness issues. We had to wash everything thoroughly before we used them. Lois and Craig are nice people and the location is great but I don’t think I would stay here again.",en

40667,6047490,2013-07-28,6575290,Will,"You'll be hard-pressed to find a better priced-room in LA during the summer than this one. It's a good location for getting around town (mostly 1 hour max by bus to get to work/good shopping, etc.), and even better if you have a car. It's right by La Cienega Blvd., which, if you're unfamiliar with LA, cuts through most of all the major streets you'll need. Michael, the host, is an affable British gent who made my stay actually feel homely - something that can be hard to find in LA. He was more a flatmate than other Airbnb hosts I've had, and given the price and location, this makes this a tempting location for students in town for summer (such as myself). There was one other guest while I was there who was also great - the apartment isn't huge, so it's an intimate environment.You probably should realise, however, that you're paying for what you're getting: everything is clean and tidy, but be aware that it's not hotel living. This is a home, and expect it to feel like one (IMHO, what I prefer anyway). There are three cats, all of whom I adored, and are real characters - they made me very welcome during my time there! Cooking is allowed, and there's a Trader Joe's relatively close by (by car), as well as other options. Michael likes his place clean, so be prepared to clean up after yourself like a responsible adult. Neighbours are very friendly and down-to-earth, and the area always seemed pretty safe. Finally, if you're into classical rock, so much the better: Michael is well-versed and passionate about the stuff, and certainly expanded my tastes while I was there.Simple, affordable, and authentic - this is no-nonsense, good quality living.

40667,34373086,2015-06-07,170845,Brett,"First, let me say that Michael is a warm and accommodating host. I had an issue on my first day that he immediately addressed. He is generous with his space, kitchen, and amenities. Very pleasant. The neighborhood is working class and conveniently located for getting around LA. My visit was 4 nights and I spent most of my time with my son at UCLA which was 15 minutes with no traffic and 30 - 40 in rush hour. Street parking at night is impossible so if you have a car I'd say that you should check with Michael about confirming a parking space which he kindly provided to me. The bed was super comfortable.  If you set your expectations properly, you will be happy at Michael's place especially at its low cost. Michael is a professional photographer and the photos he's placed on his listing are not what you will see when you enter the apartment. He did an excellent job uncluttering and lighting for his photo shoot.  In addition, the term ""gated entry"" implies something different from what is there although in the strictest sense it's true. This is not a luxury apartment so if you go in with realistic expectations, you'll be fine because Michael is warm and friendly, plays classic rock as background music, and is in a convenient location.

Travelers tip...if going to LA you really should hire a car, the public transport does not go everywhere and it will take you much longer to get anywhere if you rely on public transport.",en

I have been no more than 10 minutes at bus stop.Finally a useful tip, If you are planning to rent a van service from or to airport home trip, please, absolut avoid SuperShuttle (blue vans)...they gave me an awful service, on the contrary, PrimeTime Shuttle (reds vans) was perfect, on time, kind manners, speed, clean and modern vans.",en

There is a gentle dog who liked to quietly check in with me each time I went in or out. Olivia is very friendly. She and I were both busy so did not see each other much.

I was very relieved to find my room was exactly as the pictures and the description had shown it to be. Olivia was very kind and had everything all ready, and even though I saw little of her during my stay because of my schedule, we kept in touch through texting. I liked having the private entrance and the separate bathroom. The extra loft bed in the bedroom came in handy so that my son whom I was in LA to visit could spend a few nights there with me for a few dollars more. This house is probably not convenient if you don't have your own transportation, but I would gladly stay with the Minkins again. It was a wonderful first experience with airbnb!",en

The desk in the room was really convenient.  Next time I come to LA I will strive to bring my daughter, and hopefully stay with O&A again.  I think my daughter would love crawling up into the loft.  I felt totally welcome, and can't wait to go back. I should also add that the neighborhood was very quiet  at night as well, and there was a rear exit door as well, so that made it convenient.

It is technically the basement of the house, but does not feel like one with how nice it is. It does have its own entrance in the back with motion sensor lights for night time. Also, there is laundry on site, and even though there’s no oven in the unit, a microwave, toaster oven, coffee pot, and water boiler were supplied.

The pictures don't do it justice.  It was perfect for one person.  It was clean and just lovely.  The kitchen area worked well for me and the small refrigerator was just the right size.  It did not have a stove and oven, which I knew ahead of time, but simply brought an electric frypan to use and had no problems.  It was very clean, supplies were available, both cleaning and some basic food items, and it has access to a laundry room onsite.  That was a great time saver.  I felt it was very private and enjoyed sitting on a glider outside admiring the view of trees and the hillside and the lights from downtown in the evening.  The outdoor spaces offered both sunny and shady spaces.  I'm a writer and found it to be a great place to write and be creative.  The gardens were beautiful.  It was quiet and safe.  As a single woman traveling alone, I am always careful about safety and had no concerns about this at all.  There is a locked door on the upper-level gate with its own entrance and a double lock on the door to the apartment.  My car was parked on the cul de sac and I was not concerned about it being broken into.  Ana Maria is wonderful!  If I had any questions or concerns, she addressed them immediately.  I wasn't feeling well one evening and she obtained some medicine for me.  So thoughtful!  I would not hesitate to recommend this property.  She even had some ""goodies"" available for me when I arrived.  I was there for a month and really enjoyed it.  I was close to 134 and was able to get around the L.A. area easily.  Vons grocery story was close by along with my gym.  My month-long visit went by so quickly.  I know you will enjoy your time  at this property and felt the price was an excellent value.",en

I also loved the conversations with Nataraj and his partner about music, shared interests and life.... both are so sweet, kind, helpful and easy to communicate with. The beautiful, fully equipped kitchen is not only a great meeting place, if one wants, but also great for cooking one owns meals if one likes, again with a beautiful view over to the green hills. The location is just awesome: in 13 min. you are easily in West Hollywood for meetings, just 5 min. from wonderful hiking trails in the Hills, and in less than 10 min. you can go dining or shopping on Ventura Boulevard. In the neigborhood live lots of Musicians, Artists, Celebrities, at the same time it´s laid-back, very private, relaxed and quiet.

The house was perfect, the design is clever with a number of great indoor and outdoor spaces. The heated polished concrete floors and the roof top with deck chairs, succulent garden and a gas fire place were my personal highlights. I'm not sure how old the place is but it felt brand new. Will definitely stay here again. ",en

Really tastefully done and came with great little luxurious touches (stocked Aesop products everywhere, nice ceramic dishes, super soft towels). Above all, the location is what's most excellent. For anyone who's spent time in LA, or lived there, this is pretty much exactly where you dream to be. Walk out the door, grab a good coffee, a meal, or a beer, enjoy the sun and shop and stroll. Michael was also super responsive and welcoming. Nothing more to say, really. Great spot. Perfect for two couples. ",en

The photographs, while lovely, fail to convey the wonderful distribution of space and the seamless connection between indoors and out. Highly polished cement floors, beautiful wooden stairs, tons of glass and light and interior courtyards, catwalks and terraces abound. Walk outside and you are in the heart of Abbott Kinney, steps from all the great coffee, restaurants and interesting shops and a short, bracing ride to the beach and boardwalk. Although we did not meet face to face, Michael was nonetheless a charming and genial host... Nice towels, great beds and linens and very clean and organized. I am fastidous and I absolutely loved....If you like Venice Beach, are into modern California architecture and appreciate a miniamalist aesthetic (and don't mind a bunch of stairs) this place could not be more clean, comfortable, well situated.  We have every intention of staying there next year!",en

The location is perfect. Next, I must comment on the architecture and furnishings of this residence. It was clear to me that Michael (the owner and architect) spent a tremendous amount of time and energy thinking through every detail from a design, convenience and comfort perspective. His ingenious plan for this home also creates a sense of privacy and calm even with all of the doors and windows open. It was wonderful to spend time inside and feel like I was outdoors and then, when I needed to change or shower, feel perfectly secluded and private within his open floor plan. Perfection achieved. Finally, the comfortable, cozy, modern beds and other things that matter (many places to sit, great views, two private courtyard areas, a large private balcony overlooking Abbot Kinney (with an outdoor fireplace), a wonderful dining room table for a special dinner with close friends) were all, quite simply, perfect. This residence is a dream. Would I live there and be entirely satisfied? Yes. Would I stay again tonight? ABSOLUTELY! Honestly, it could not have been more perfect in any way. Wow! ",en

Heath Ceramics dishware, Tractor stools etc. Also, it's lovely be able to be inside and outside all within the footprint of the home. The location is terrific, with dozens of local shops and restaurants right outside the door. It's a little bit tricky to keep that metal countertop in the kitchen clean - it just want to be smear-y, but that's a teeny tiny complaint.

My girlfriend and I (and our dog) sub-letted Robin's entire home for 4 months while she was away in South America. For us, it was the perfect way to transition our new lives from Chicago into Los Angeles. The neighborhood is diverse, quiet, and conveniently located just off the highway. There are lots of breathtaking hiking trails nearby, and of course plenty of fun restaurants to try (many of the best ones were already recommended by Robin in advance). Robin was excellent with responding to questions and concerns and took care of everything immediately! From thousand of miles away! Her home is fantastic, with a very comfortable bed, insanely great water pressure and heating, all tucked away in a very serene and, yes tranquil, environment. If you have Robin as your host, consider yourself lucky. They don't get more amenable, charming, responsive, and kind than Robin. We had a great stay.",en

Loved the local recommendations and often walked down to Lemon Poppy for a coffee and incredible pastries. There's also a cool plant store that opened up called The Juicy Leaf that's worth checking out. We loved outdoor, socially distanced drinks at Verdugo Bar, with a special shout-out to their regular food vendor 2Guys1Taco for making us feel right at home. It's worth checking out the walks through the neighborhood as well. We saw a few coyotes during our stay, which was cool from a distance, but would recommend folks be careful with their little pets! Elyria Canyon Park was excellent for dog-walking away from crowds as well. Overall, Robin and her team on the ground were responsive, communicative, and excellent hosts. Worth a visit!",en

75512,728154,2011-11-18,1129256,Jordan,"Staying with Lane was absolutely magical. The house is warm and inviting and with an air of experience that Anthropologie wishes it could sell you. She was nothing but helpful in getting to the house and even before when we weren't sure if my staying with her would work out. When it looked darkest, she even offered to find me other spaces to stay in case it wouldn't. The bed was warm, the room spacious and clean, and I even had a drawer in the kitchen for my muffins in the morning and a space in the fridge for leftovers. Everything about the house and the stay was a dream, even for my too short stay of four days. I would recommend her to anyone in a heartbeat that is traveling to the LA area (although I'm hesitant to do so - staying with Lane feels like a secret I want to keep all to myself!) and would eagerly stay with her again.

In LA for work I rarely saw Lane for more than a couple of minutes a day but she always made sure that I had everything I needed.  I arrived on REALLY short notice and Lane took me in with open arms and a map of LA to help me get my bearings!

I arranged for my parents to stay with her so that they could be near me in LA as I was moving , and even though it was short notice, Lane was able to accommodate us. But, there is more to it than that, Lane helped me organize their stay, made sure of their comfort, and offered a variety of things to do. From the time I've spent with her I can clearly say that she's a great conversationalist with a wide range of interests.

I enjoyed both quietness and convenience from living close to Wilshire. Miracle mile is such a nice residential area and a lively neighborhood. Lane took good care of the house and respect the privacy. We didn't see each other very often but always had a nice talking since I was doing intern in an architecture firm.

84694,25319106,2015-01-12,3179901,Ken,"The Bamboo 1 bed apartment I stayed in with my dog was a nice apartment with a great view overlooking the Hollywood Hills. Henry was a very attentive host and generally very helpful. I'm not sure if other reviewers are referring to the same apartment, yet this one doesn't have a bath (only a shower). I stayed for a month in this apartment and unfortunately we had a few issues during our stay. I had sporadic wifi access which Henry promptly fixed, yet if you need to be contactable this area unfortunately has poor 3G access on T-Mobile and AT&T. I often had no or little reception and could not make nor receive any phone calls here. We also had issues with heating where one room was over heating whist the other was ice cold, which Henry was fixing (I believe the entire surrounding area was affected). The walls of the apartment are quite thin and you can hear the tenants upstairs and to the right of you - so unfortunately, I did not always get the best sleep. It would have been nice if this was a fully self contained apartment, as I enjoy having the privacy of my own place, yet unfortunately the washing machine and dryer is communal and shared, so the front access area you will often bump into the other tenants or Henry doing the washing - or if you're sleeping in, you'll hear the commotion outside. Although Henry works in the shed upstairs and is always ready to help, there was a lot of maintenance going on during my stay, and sometimes it would have been nice to receive sufficient notice before people were walking around hacking bamboo or clearing things up (even if it was presumed I wasn't home as I parked further down the street) - as on quite a few occasions I was often woken up by the noise and found it rather intrusive - especially if I was already kept awake most of the night by the loud tenants upstairs. I'm trying to be as fair as I can with this review, and it's a bit of a shame really as this is a very nice apartment!  I just didn't manage to get the restful peace, sleep and tranquility that I was looking for. I'm sure Henry will seek to address some of these issues moving forward, so you will likely have a much more enjoyable stay. ",en
84694,26629919,2015-02-16,23191695,Rocco,"This place is THE place to get work done, if that's what you're after. The Hollywood sign lingers on the horizon like a specter of all that is possible in this crazy town, and the relaxing layout/unique architecture of the place puts the ""FUN"" in feng shui, a sentence I never thought I would type but here I am doing just that. Henry, your host, is the consummate gentleman you would hope to find at $700-plus-a-night hotels but who never seems to materialize (or only materializes with a hand extended for a tip) at such establishments. He even brought us a spare wine glass and fresh orchids shortly into our stay. In the warmer weather, which is most of the time, all of the windows and, basically, walls can be slid open for the fresh air that only the hills can bring. Also, if you have a special someone it is a highly romantic retreat. I would give him, and the place, 20 stars if I could. Highly recommended. ",en

Its nice to have a manager who truly cares about his tenants.The properties were all just like the pictures and offer very peaceful settings close to downtown Hollywood.

85246,2708256,2012-10-24,262716,Itai,"My stay with Nati and Eddie was a dream. The room is beautiful and spacious with lots of storage space: a whole wardrobe closet and several large shelves, a desk with large drawers. This is the most space i've had in an AirBnB rental, including when i rented entire apartments! The room came with its own private, adjacent bathroom that was likewise beautiful and spacious with a great water pressure from the shower. The room looks out to a backyard. It is very well lit. Its only flaw, and it is minor, is that It is not very sound-proof with respect to the rest of the apartment. The super cute neighborhood, Wilshire Vista, is residential, safe and quiet, consisting of lovely cottages with private lawns and yards. Population is young families and bohemians. Despite its suburban feel, it is very centrally located: two blocks away from Fairfax, two blocks away from Pico, a 10 minute walking distance to La Cienega, a 30 minute walking distance to the fancy Grove mall. Walgreens, 7/11 and CVS are just a few blocks away, as well as a nice little hipster cafe and a bunch of cheap and tasty Ethiopian restaurants and a Hertz car dealership. Public trasportation is convenient from Fairfax, Pico and La Cienega, but bear in mind that sprawling Los Angeles, despite having good public transportation, is best experienced with a car at hand. Free parking spaces can always be found within a couple of blocks from the house. The house itself is a large and handsome two family unit with a front lawn and a concrete back yard (that the room overlooks). The apartment is large and is conveniently equipped with a washer and a dryer and a shelf was provided for me in the refrigerator in the fully stocked kitchen. If this was the end of the story, this room would be the perfect place to rent in LA. But it gets even better, much better, as the hostesses, Eddie and Nati, are the loveliest, warmest, most hospitable people i've stayed with. They are real American entrepreneurs of the 2000s, operating various businesses besides AirBnB hosting that i had the pleasure of taking advantage of: a photography studio, a chauffeur service (the cheapest, easiest way to get from the airport to their home guaranteed) and a small fleet of cars for rent. Their house is always bustling with friends and clients, but they always have time for you. They made me feel like part of the family from the onset and i shared some of the most memorable evenings of my stay in LA in their pleasant company. When i stayed there, two other lovely girls stayed there as well, whom it was a delight to meet. A warm shoutout to Mary-Ann and Charlotte. The three cats make the picture complete: a curious yet aloof ginger, a cuddly, sociable gray and a typical teenager black. I've left my heart at Wilshire Vista and i'll be back. Thank you, girls!",en

I didn’t use the television so I can’t speak to that but everything else worked as it should. The water gets super hot (which is great!) but watch out. It was nice having a front yard and a place to park. Having a driveway gate was a little frustrating having to open and close it all the time and if I got deliveries they couldn’t leave it unless I was home. But for safety, I guess it made sense to leave it closed? Plenty of space to put food, clothes and feel like you could make it your own a bit. I only rented the front half of the house and during most of my stay there was someone living in the back garage which was no problem at all. When someone came to stay in the shared back part of the same house as mine I could hear them and assume they could hear me- so that was a little unfortunate for privacy, but luckily for my stay didn’t last too long.Overall, I thought the space was laid out well, Heather was great, but Tujunga is what Tujunga is.",en

No television or internet make this a great space to unplug and unwind. Appliances are newer and the guesthouse is cozy and well appointed for cooking. Bedroom, bedding & linens are broken in and give the feel that you are staying with an old friend. The property is gated and the shared backyard has a lovely, peaceful garden and areas for lounging. Hummingbirds visited me every afternoon! Nestled on a quiet street in an urban setting, surrounding area can be a little rough so this is a better fit for city dwellers. I would also recommend guests rent a car as there are not many stores or restaurants within walking distance. Cheryl is a great host, there was an issue with the gas but she very responsive and took care of it right away. She went above & beyond, leaving some breakfast items for me including: fresh fruit, bagels, eggs, juice and bottled water, a new iron & coffeemaker, and clothes detergent for a couple of loads of laundry. She is an LA rarity, an actress with a heart of gold, an infectious laugh & down-to-earth personality. She even called to check up on me (I had gotten a plane cold during my flight to LA)! Great value especially for longer-term stays! ",en

We even got coffee together and talked about graphic design/music. She told me about a very exciting project she was working on for artists around the globe. If you'd like to stay with conscious minded people who know how to throw a good party this is the place to be. Yet you can also keep to yourself in the comfy room and do your work without being bothered. Highly recommended.",en
96334,359138,2011-07-07,729306,Harold,"This was my first time using AirBnB and I was nervous about it because the idea of stay at a strangers place kinda frightening. Well, my mind was put at ease when I stepped up to the door and was greeted by a friendly face. Everyone in household was great. Very generous and engaging. On my first night I got in and was hungry, Julie not only recommended some great places for food, she took me there herself. Her and everyone in the household made me feel very welcomed.The room I stayed in, like the rest of the house, was clean and was everything I needed. The bed was big and comfortable, plenty of space in the closet, and enough electrical outlets for my electronic devices. I was worried about the California heat making it uncomfortable, but there was AC and the room had a ceiling fan. I slept like a baby!Julie herself is an amazing person. She's kind, generous, and great to talk to. When we first met she gave me a hug, which I loved, because I'm a hugger. Though I wasn't at the house too often, the times when she and I were there, we had great conversations about design, music, business, photography, etc. Our talks were very inspiring to me.I turned to AirBnB because I was stuck in a rut. My plans to stay at my friend's place fell through and I didn't want to change the dates I booked for my vacation. I chose Julie's place because of the inexpensive rate and the creative room aspect intrigued me. I'm so glad I chose it because it was worth the great experience. If I were I LA again, and was in the same situation, I would totally go to Julie again. Even if I already have a place to stay, if I had the opportunity I would come just to visit. Totally recommended!",en

After we figured out LA a little bit it took us about 45 Minutes to Venice Beach and about 35 Minutes to go to Hollywood. But that´s not a long time when you are in LA. You have to take your car all the time!!!Julie and her roommate are the best. Open to answer any question and just very positive women.I absolutely recommend it!,en

My room was spacious and super clean. I had access to wifi, kitchen and all other facilities in the house. Although initially I was planning to stay there for only 1 night, I had so much fun that I ended up staying there a bit longer. Julie is best described as a SUPER HERO. She is very mindful about every thing and every one around her and when she is not surfing with sharks or creating mind blowing art or inspiring her friends, she is working tirelessly and passionately on some innovative projects to create values and peace in the society to help and benefit every one in the world. I consider myself extremely fortunate to have known such wonderful and inspiring person and I can’t wait to get back to LA and stay at Julie's house again. Hopefully this time I’ll stay a bit longer.

My bedroom was very comfy, with a great bed and enough space for everything. The location in The Valley, was very convenient for me, as I had a course to attend nearby, and public transport was handy, as I didn't have a car. I would probably recommend having a car though, if you really want ease of getting around, and you want to do a bit of sight seeing. The public transport is there, but it is slow and not so easy to negotiate!I really enjoyed getting to know Julie and Karin a little, and some of the discussions we had were really interesting and thought provoking. This accommodation situation, for me, was far preferable to staying in an anonymous hotel, and also far cheaper! So much nicer to be part of a household, and essentially, that is what it is - you are sharing a home and participating in a household. Of course, if you are going to be out for the bulk of the time, you are mainly just coming back to a cosy and comfy bedroom to use, and a good shower, plus a kitchen if you need one to do some cooking. Julie and Karin are not at all intrusive and do leave you to your own devices of course, but they also regularly check to see if you need anything. Personally, I really enjoyed the set up where I could feel like I was living in a shared household, as I was there to do a course, and not so much to sight see (although I managed to do that too!).Overall, I would definitely recommend these wonderful hosts.

The main room was generously sized, comfortable and tidy, equipped with everything we required, as well as anything that would have made our stay pleasurable.

Bed was very comfortable and sleeping while adjusting to a new timezone was easy as there are black out blinds. Noise was not an issue either.

Also, the room has no air at all, so be prepared for that as well.",en

Johnny was always just a text away if I had any questions, be it regarding the space or suggestions as far as where to grab a cup of coffee or bite to eat. This was my first time using airbnb, and regarding that I couldn't have asked for a better experience. The room was clean, as was the guest bathroom at all times, and there was never heavy foot traffic or noise. The neighborhood is also nice and quiet. You'll have no problems getting a good nights sleep. At the same time, it's right around the corner from Hollywood Blvd., so food, bars, shops, and theaters are just a quick walk away, and public transits close by as well. So you're getting the best of both worlds. All and all It's been a great experience at Johnnys, and i'm glad i had the opportunity to experience his hospitality and abode.",en

Though she may be overseas while staying at her location, she always responds quickly to emails and even has a manager in California to help take care of things. He is also very pleasant to work with. The location is great for commute if you are working in the san fernando valley. Another thing we really appreciated about this location is that it is a corner townhouse, this means barely any of the walls are shared. We have never heard the neighbors and they seem to never hear us. There is also a very clean pool, though there is very little to no deck area to enjoy lounging by the pool. Ines does well to keep the place ready for the next guests, what it may lack in modern flair and order is certainly made up for by the generous amount of amenities such as toilet paper, garbage bags, and a kitchen absolutely stocked with everything you need besides food!

Originally a friend of mine was suppose to stay as well but her plans changed last minute (the day of arrival) and Ines was understanding and easy to compromise with about how we were now going to split the rent. She's a very kind, outgoing woman and always had funny stories to share and good advice to give. She respects your personal space and is a clean roommate. Prior to arrival she was easy to contact and kept everything very organized. She kept everything in writing and had me sign a rental agreement when I came. My boyfriend came to visit a few times during my trip and Ines was always welcoming and friendly. The location of the town house is across the street from a police station so I always felt safe and it is within walking distance of many restaurants and a 24 hour fitness that I visited daily.

I was a little thrown off during our initial phone call because I wasn't expecting a small deposit, but we did a proper short-term lease agreement (we both kept copies of it) and my deposit was returned as promised at the end of my stay. She merely wants to make sure the place is well-maintained and not trashed by occupants, which she clearly has done a good job of doing. I was given comfortable living space, access to the kitchen, my own bathroom, the privacy I like and could come and go as I please as long as I was quiet. I felt right at home and I was glad I choose her place to stay! I also love her friendly dog Jackie! And when I needed to stay an extra night at the last minute, Ines was super accommodating. And after I checked out and left something behind, she drove and dropped it off where I was. She goes the extra mile and is a great roommate. Worth every penny and I highly recommend her place.",en

The rest of the home has a slight rustic feel with antlers and candles lining the walls and a pleasant aroma filling the air. The kitchen has all the essentials you'd need to do as much or as little cooking as you'd like. David is also trained chef and will share his creations from time to time. As for the location, there are several major supermarkets within walking distance. LA is notorious for having poor public transit but there are also several bus stops within walking distance as well.

Lied about amenities which were supposed to be there, specifically an AC which was a big priority for me and when I asked him to install it he refused to. Most shockingly there was a cat living with him and this was never mentioned. I stayed with my sister who’s highly allergic and suffered for it because the animal had clearly been inside the room.

121717,7445697,2013-09-20,2687969,Michael,This home is a continuous rental so has more of a corporate apartment/hotel feel than a lived-in place. Pros and cons on that of course depending on taste.  Well equipped and furnished. Master bed is comfortable.  Bring your own soap and shampoo.  Nice neighborhood and big well-furnished backyard.  About 15 minutes to heart of Pasadena including winding mountain road for about 3/4 mile to navigate.  AC and heat very noisy so I only ran it when I wan't there and that worked.  Could be too noisy for sleep or comfortable time in space if you had to run it. Owner provided lovely gift food and wine basket which is much appreciated.  You are asked to strip linens and round up towels and clean dishes at end.,en

The coffee shop a one minute walk away was a life saver a few times (try their meals too, they are great!).

Just one thing to note: cell service is hit or miss in this part of Echo Park, but its not too much of an issue once you hook up to the WiFi. Its a nice place to unplug if thats what youre looking for though. :) Thanks for everything, Michelle!",en

185536,354111609,2018-11-30,5051641,Monika,"I stayed at Laura’s house for two and a half months. Laura is a very warm and welcoming person; however, the accommodation situation was not exactly what I expected it to be with regard to the hygienic situation in the kitchen and the bathroom. The house is located in a nice, safe and calm residential area in the west of L.A. It is near to shops for all daily needs, near to LAX, to the beach and to Loyola Marymount University. There are busses running to Venice, Santa Monica and Downtown L.A. Laura is very welcoming and friendly. She often gave me a ride to nearby directions, such as the laundry and the airport, which is very helpful as it is sometimes a bit difficult to get around in L.A. without a car.Your room: The room is quite big, nicely decorated and there are enough shelves and chests of drawers to stow all your clothes and stuff. The bed is comfortable and there is also a desk for eating and working. You even have your own fridge in the room, which is very practical. The kitchen: You can use the kitchen at any time of the day and Laura provides a solid choice of kitchen devices and utensils for her guests. However, for me the hygienic situation in the kitchen was difficult. There is always a lot of stuff on the work surfaces like used plastic bags, dog food, groceries and vegetable waste waiting for compost. In the sink there is often a pile of dirty dishes waiting to be cleaned. I would have preferred a cleaner place for cooking.The bathroom: The bathroom is shared by three people, but I never had to wait for it to be free as everybody cared about not spending too much time there. Like in the kitchen, the hygienic situation in the bathroom was difficult for me. As Laura does not use the bathroom, she does not care about cleaning it. The guests are supposed to clean it, but there is no schedule. During my stay, I rarely saw another guest cleaning the bathroom and I ended up cleaning it myself.Given my experience, I would not choose to stay at the place for such a long time again. The accommodation might be good for a shorter stay, but especially the hygienic conditions became difficult for me as I stayed longer. I am sorry to write this because Laura is a very nice person. However, I want to give an honest review for possible future guests so that they better know what to expect…",en

194809,64256713,2016-03-01,591902,Erin,"Ive stayed a lot of places and never left a negative review. But I cant in good conscience recommend this experience. The listing and photos are very inaccurate. The photos are stretched and distorted to make the space look much bigger than it is and to hide the fact that it's old and has tons of cardboard boxes stacked in every available space. The photo of the bedroom looks spacious when in reality is much smaller and half the room was taken up by the paintingand cardboard boxes toppling all over each other behind it. That said it does have a bed so if you don't need much room for a suitcase it will suffice. The bed looked made until we realized not only was there no top sheet, the yellowed spit covered pillows didn't even have pillow cases. The bathroom was fairly clean except the only thing in it was 1 towel and a really nasty dirty old bar of soap. The patio had obviously not been cleaned in a very long time and there were old boxes and piles of rusty junk. When I asked the host about the patio she said she didn't bother cleaning it because she never went out there (then don't advertise it!) She then asked us for an additional cleaning fee and insisted we replace every product we use in the house, from each Ziploc and tissue to toilet paper. She also wanted to arrange multiple times for us to be home so she could bring someone in to take care of various issues. Less than ideal when trying to enjoy your vacation. The place, while not like in the photos, is livable, I was most disappointed by Michelle. Her response in our conversation was that she was out of state. If she wants good reviews she has to pay for and designate someone to tend to the place while she's away. I really felt she did not see us as guests deserving respect and gratitude for paying her a significant amount of money but instead someone little better than homeless people who should fall at her feet for letting us stay there. Weve stayed multiple times in airbnbs and have hosted ourselves multiple times. Being a good airbnb host means providing AT LEAST clean towels, sheets and toilet paper and making sure the space is clean and free of excess junk. I don't think Michelle grasps this concept. ",en

The place is rad and it totally meets the description given. It is cozy. It is well-maintained. It has everything you need for a short-term or extended stay. Also it is very private and far back off of Morton Ave so you don't really get any street noise. It is extremely peaceful and low-key. The neighborhood is rad also. There are plenty of restaurants, bars, music venues, cultural activities, sporting activities, etc. all within walking distance. Also, you are just a short drive away from downtown LA, Pasadena, the west side, Hollywood, etc.",en

The space is cozy and perfect with a small kitchen and lots of storage space. I'm traveling for work and Ramiro has been very flexible and the upstairs couple are lovely as well. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to be close to great food, trails with views, and close to sunset blvd. I literally walk where ever I need and it's close to the grocery and laundry as well. Even though it's close to everything it is also very quiet and relaxing. Street parking is always easy except for rare occassions when there are block parties or events going on. For the price you just can't beat it.",en
246092,131573234,2017-02-12,8005435,Sasha,"Absolutely love this studio! It is the perfect location for a single person to stay long-term (or even a couple for a short-term stay). The studio is well-equipped with everything you need: oven, microwave, toaster, coffee pot, mini-fridge, dishes, towels, extra bed linens, cleaning supplies, and basic paper products. I stayed long-term and having all this available made my life so much easier.The studio itself is tucked away in the back of a long driveway so there is no noise that comes from the busy street. Quiet, quaint, with lots of greenery around. The only noise I ever heard was from the birds chirping! Absolutely lovely. The space itself is relatively small, but perfect for one person long-term. Really comfortable queen-sized bed, functional bathroom with shower, and a little kitchen nook with counter space. Plenty of dresser/closet space as well. The location is pretty fun as well. Lots of young people, walking distance to cafes, drug store, grocery store, cute little shops, restaurants, and tooons of taco trucks! It's also on the other side of Elysian Park which makes it easy to go for a pretty, scenic walk or a run if you're into that. I felt very safe walking around. Also, there's usually plenty of street parking. My only issue was upon arrival there was a minor gas leak coming from the new oven that had been installed and not tightened properly. However, Ramiro was in contact with me immediately, sent out the repair guy, and everything was fixed within a couple hours! Ramiro has been extremely responsive and easy to get ahold of for any questions or concerns I had. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others. ",en

Also walking distance from dodger stadium and Elysian Park and very short drive to Downtown. The studio has great space for clothes, mini fridge, stove, oven, microwave, sink, and shower.

253683,3849839,2013-03-20,3667046,L,"William is amazing! I was looking for a rental place for a week-long vacation for my mom. While I am very used to vacation rentals ( (Hidden by Airbnb) , (Hidden by Airbnb) , (Hidden by Airbnb) ), my mom isn't. Her only point of reference was a failed rental attempt last winter when someone attempted to scam us on a rental in NY. I had to let her know that not all vacation rentals are like that. So I was looking for a place that was nice, clean, and centrally located. But more importantly, one where the owner would be honest and very easy to work with.  I found all of that with William. William was very straight forward in his communications, responded very quickly, and answered all of my questions without hesitation. And when, as a new user of airbnb I was getting frustrated with the validation and payment process. William walked me through, talked me down, and generally held my hand through it all. William was charming and gracious with my mom. He showed her around the place, which was, according to her, even better than described online. She was amazed at the amenities given. It wasn't a bare bones, plates/glasses/silverware/salt & pepper kind of place. If someone needed a place to live, they could move right in without having to buy a single thing. Apparently William has thought of everything and spared nothing in outfitting his rental.The only negative was that the home is on a busy main street, sometimes making it hard to get into and out of. But that isn't enough to be a deterrent. My mom would not only stay there but is suggesting that we plan a trip for her birthday later this year.Thank you William for making this painless and for making sure that my mom had a great vacation renal experience.",en

I visit LA frequently and use air Bnb and never experienced any problems before. I always ask BEFORE booking ""Is your accommodation wheelchair accessible?"" When I was told ""yes"" I expected it to be. If you call being on a VERY steep hill PLUS one huge step into the property then another smaller step to get through the door, it was a complete nightmare for the whole two weeks I was there. Getting up the hill was dangerous for me, needing my fiancé & brother to assist me every time I went out. Sometimes I even chose to stay in because it was such a hassle so it even affected the quality of my time. We had to rent a ramp for two weeks to get in property and still needed assistance as it was steep. When we called upon arrival I told them this property is not wheelchair accessible like they stated and they were quite rude saying ""Well we have had other wheelchair users stay here"" and I replied ""You should not assume that all wheelchair users are the same. Some can walk, but I'm totally paralysed so when I ask if it's accessible I expect it to be and this accommodation is quite clearly NOT!""Even the garden which was pictured was just a tiny area at the end of a driveway and not accessible.The inside of the apartment was shabby and in dire need of a lick of paint and new curtains for starters.We had a visit from them with a bottle of wine, an apology and a small contribution towards the cost of hiring of ramp. 70 dollars but it actually cost us 175 dollars.All in all it ruined my time.

Kat's home includes many lovely decorative touches and is a reader's paradise - lots of great books and magazines!

It is kept so beautiful, neat and tidy that we felt at home immediately:) The flat is located in such a beautiful and peaceful neighborhood where we enjoyed taking a walk every day and is at a very convenient location to enjoy all the Californian dream destinations - Santa Monica, Malibu etc! And most importantly, we could not be more grateful for Kat's amazing hospitality! From the first email exchange, I could feel her kindness, and until the day we left, she was always reachable and kindly answered any questions we had - we were very grateful for her support and felt very relieved. Thank you very much Kat for everything and we really do hope to come back again very soon!! My parents send you their best regards too! ",en

We were delighted by Kat's online profile of her home and the pictures were accurate to the actual setting and amenities.  It was especially nice to have Kuan Yin the goddess of compassion watching over us while there, as well as being so close to the Yogananda Lake Shrine just down the street.  Kat's place is clearly a private home with a artist's vibe and not a commercial boarding house or rental property undertaking.  The house itself is a two-story duplex structure (ours was the entire second floor) in the middle of a block within a residential neighborhood that has very easy access to all desired points and services (i.e. beaches, restaurants and major thoroughfares)... this being California and not NYC you'll definitely need a car to get around, but even if you were on foot or on a bike you could get by staying at this location without any trouble at all and even enjoy easy access to main lines of public transportation, if that's your preference.  It's great place to chill out and base your SoCal activities and I recommend it.  We'll be back.",en

The location is in a cute Palisades neighborhood with lots of charm. Since it is a primary residence, everything is very well appointed and you have everything you need to get by.  Kat was very friendly and communicative, however the downstairs neighbor was a tad on the grumpy side about very small issues like stepping around too loud and leaving the porch light on at night, but we were there for a couple of weeks, and I don't see it being an issue for shorter stays. As a host the only one thing I would really complain about is having to clean up at the end of my stay after paying over $100 for a cleaning fee (I normally would anyway, but being asked to is just kind of an erk).

The original house we'd reserved had to be cancelled at the last minute due to a problem with the property.  With only 4 days to go before we were to arrive for a trip we'd planned for almost a year, Mindy came to my rescue.  She went well out of her way to ready this home for us in between other reservations she had.  I'm SO glad the first home didn't work out, because this home is just fantastic.  Modern, clean, great location!  We enjoyed a beautiful dinner on the stunning patio (complete with a very unique table with a fire running down the middle), cooked by a professional chef we hired that couldn't say enough about how well-appointed and fabulous the kitchen was.The entire decor of the home is spa-like, with nothing but the finest furnishings, linens and appliances.Close to Hollywood and Beverly Hills, the house is in a great neighborhood and a close walk to the market or nearby shops.I can't say enough about our experience and about this owner.  The house was great, Mindy (the owner) was even greater and we can't wait to plan another girls' trip so we can rent her home again.",en

Every time I thought I had seen all the amenities I would discover another, like the immersion blender! The sleeping arrangements were very comfortable, large bedrooms, good mattresses, all very clean and I loved the modern aesthetic.And I had never spent time in West Hollywood, great neighborhood.

We also had our own patio area to lounge and Andrea's property is so beautiful with all her plants / garden. Andrea lives right upstairs and always there to help you if you need anything at all. Echo park is such beautiful area with ample parking, trails, coffee shops all walking distance. I also had a cousin driving through LA for a couple days and Andrea was sweet enough to provide extra blankets and pillows to allow her to bunk on the couch (which turns into a sofa bed btw).

The room I was assigned in was a double and roommate was clean. Rooms are clean and organized. Lots of signage and notes to help you navigate around the house. It pretty quiet and its not a ""party house"" area is not ghetto. The only thing that sucks about this place is PARKING.  Street parking sucks so much. If you're planning to come back after 6 from driving somewhere, you are pretty much S.O.L. I was a little bit freaked out having to park 3 blocks away one night.

Also close to many bus lines if you are not driving and there are stores not too far walking distance. It is a generally safe area but I wouldn't wander around late at night too much. Drawbacks are lack of parking and if it matters, there is only AC in the TV room (plenty of fans though). Close to downtown but some distance to the westside (i.e. Santa Monica, Marina Del Rey, etc.) Also, free Wifi available but sometimes slow to connect.

Not only was the building really old, it was a cool old.  No television, perfect, we're there for the beach not the television.  In room wifi if you needed it, and a computer in the room if you didn't bring your laptop.  (convenient?)  yes.I had a car and parked it free for two days only 1.5 blocks away, perfection.All around totally comfortable surroundings, place and I will return again since the first stay was good.P.S. if you rent a bike, skateboard, what have you, mention you are staying at the hostel and you get 10% discount.",en

It's right next to the beach and the posh Abbot Kinney street was easily accessible by foot. The immediate neighborhood is a little sketchy, so be prepared for that.

Check-in was efficient, kellie organized it nicely. It was a large House, large backyard, nice people, nice dog.

It was weird, the first two days I parked there, no problem; then the last day, I received a parking tickets stating ""no parking during 7-9a.m."" or something like that.

308582,19790470,2014-09-18,3824514,Freddie,"The positives:It's something like one of those rooming houses in San Francisco, shared bathroom and all, but nicer than that. It's VERY clean, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was nice, good shower, etc. There are plenty of drawers in the bathroom in which to store toiletries. The common areas are nice, and there's a kitchen on each floor if you want to do you own cooking. There's also a nice courtyard where one can lounge. The folks who stay there are quite international, and very nice. And the price was reasonable.The minuses:The use of the word ""oasis"" is actually quite literal.  You are truly in the middle of a desert of nothingness when you're here. There's not even anywhere to walk to in the morning to have a cup of coffee; not even a Starbucks or anything like that. The closest safe neighborhood would be about a mile away, on Wilshire, at the beginning of Koreatown. So if you want to go to a cafe, have breakfast and coffee, etc. you need to get in your car and drive there. You won't want to walk as it's not in one of the nicer areas in LA (a fact that I did not know when I booked it, because I'm not all that familiar with LA). It looks rather like a safe residential area on the surface, but that's deceptive. When I told my friends in LA where I was staying they were concerned and advised me not to park my car more than a block away, because they don't advise walking around there at night. I actually had a rather dodgy experience in a convenience store that was around the corner. I went in to buy a bottle of water, and some local kids came in right after me and got into a scuffle with the guy behind the counter. This was all going on while my wallet was open and I was trying to pay. Very disconcerting. Being more of a night owl myself the neighborhood proved to be an inconvenience, because once I was in for the night, I was in. I didn't feel comfortable walking around there, and even if I had, there was nothing  to go back out to anyway. No local deli or pizza joint, or even a drugstore should I have needed anything. There's nothing there.  Also the wifi works fine in the common areas, but if you need to have privacy with your computer forget it, because once you go back into your room the wifi pretty much disappears. So although there is free internet, it's useless in your room. This isn't an issue for everyone, but it's worth noting for those it would affect.Also although there are fans everywhere, there's no air conditioning at all. So if you can't sleep in ninety plus degree LA heat, don't go during the summer lol!All in all worth the money, but probably would not do it again.",en

This place is like college dorm and there are not rules about what time they should stop to make noise, beside  there is no anyone to complain during night.  The office is closed at 5pm, but no one responsible about the building after that time.  We could not sleep the three nights because the noise, we had to leave that place after the third night.

320747,4664568,2013-05-19,1386798,Emir,"Pete left a review of us as a guest saying he was disappointed by the messy state in which we left his place based on apparent feedback from his cleaning woman on having to take out a decent amount of trash from the indoor trash bins. We left his home clean and had a very positive interaction with his cleaning woman Angelina upon our departure.I suspect Pete's review was influenced by the lead up and outcome of Airbnb arbitration which ruled in our favor on an unsecured large glass coffee table that our 3 year old daughter broke after she leaned on it and it flipped over and broke. We are very grateful the glass did not hurt our daughter when it fell. We offered to pay for the replacement of the glass but expressed to Peter that we thought it was irresponsible of him to leave an unstable glass table in his home for guests without giving us any heads up that the table could be easily tipped over (especially with small children staying in his home).Pete rejected our offer to replace the glass directly or pay him the cost of the glass and took the case to arbitration asking for the cost of the glass plus the delivery charge and the taxes on the table and delivery charge. Airbnb ruled in our favor and we paid him for just the cost of the glass.Despite our experience with the coffee table, we had a good stay and the following are our review of Pete's home-Upsides:Backyard is enclosed and secured.Backyard has a barbeque, a swing and a tetherball game great for families.The home is full of toys perfect for small children.The home is close to downtown Hermosa, grocery shopping and a fantastic children’s playground.There is a lovely green path across the street, great for exercise.10-15 minute walk to beach (half-mile). Price was reasonable.Home was comfortable.Downsides:Home was not properly secured for small children (unstable glass coffee table and unsecured cleansers under the sinks at ground level).There is no dishwasher, and kitchen utensils were dirty upon arrival, requiring washing before use. Sheets were threadbare.Home is located on a busy street with car traffic noise.Reading Pete other review is not incongruous with our experience. Outside of our interaction with Pete, our issues were more or less resolved prior to the arrival of the next guests since we had cleaned the kitchen utensils and the glass coffee table was gone having broke it.",en
320747,4800165,2013-05-27,4500858,Lesley,"Pete's home in Hermosa Beach was perfect!  The location is ideal!  It is close to the pier, shopping, green area and play area for children and most importantly....the beach and shopping!  There is good places to eat close by and lots to see.  Grocery shops are very close and everything you want is pretty much within walking or biking distance.  The house itself is perfect.  I grew up in the Midwest where A/C is a necessity so coming into a home without it was a huge concern, but even during the last week of May it was perfect.  We had the doors open and with a little fan in the master bedroom it was too cold most nights!!!!   The living room is comfy and inviting.  The sectional is perfect and the big screen TV is awesome.  The kitchen is stocked and allows you to cook and communicate with people in the living room and dining room.   The fenced in backyard is perfect for families with children.  Our 3.5 year old had the time of his life.  He loved all the toys they left out for us.  He couldn't wait to get up each morning and run out to play and we felt good because it was a privacy fence and totally secure.  There are 3 good size bedrooms.  One is a child's room with a little toddler bed.  The other bedroom has a comfy queen bed and plenty of space.  The master is an oasis.  It has a sitting area with a desk and an awesome master bath plus a great master closet and a sliding doors to the back yard.  My only complaint was that the queen size bed was a little too firm for us.  Everything else was perfect like it was made for my family.  We had 3 adults (myself, my husband, my mother-in-law and our 3.5 year old) and it was a perfect fit.  If we are ever back in Southern California we will only (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was awesome and he is just a great person!  You will not regret staying here.

The house was quite cold (and seemed to be even colder inside than it was outside) and the heaters were broken.  Emmy had informed us that there were space heaters available, but even though we requested them when it got cold, she never brought them to us.  We were very uncomfortable the last two days and especially the last night of our stay, even though we put all the blankets we could find on the beds and wore our sweaters and socks.

She is a friendly host full of stories and helpful tips. You will find her apartment also acts as a mini museum full of relics from Marilyn's various travels around the world.

Also one block from La Brea where you can find restaurants, hip clothing stores and other thrills but her street stays quiet like a small town. ",en
350756,53874141,2015-11-14,32083760,Sarah,"Marylin is a wonderful lady. I stayed here for 3 months while I worked. It didn't feel very ""homey"" to me. Very sporadic decor, no flow, very outdated. No insulation in the apt so it's very chilly right now. Heater provided doesn't actually warm the room. And in summer very hot as you're upatairs also. There is a window air unit but then there was an issue with the electric bill rising during the hot months. Parking is a nightmare but Good location to restraunts. The bed was a huge issue as it is on the floor and you can feel and hear the  springs move when you do. I brought it to her attention and she tried to fix it buy giving me money to go get a foam topper for it bc she doesn't have time.I did and it's still not good. Too far brokem for a temp fix. Very old apt,built in 40s and hasn't been updated since like the 70s??  I would not recommend to anyone until a new mattress is bought. I start chiropractic visits next week. Very nice to have your own bathroom in this city. Apt is a very good size but no tv except in bed rooms and it's from the early 90s. Sound is going out.  I did enjoy meeting marylin, she is a great person but the apt needs some updates. She is hardly ever there and we had very opposite schedules.  But very friendly and helpful as far as knowing places to eat and things to do.",en

Host was out of country and had friend help with check in. I sat outside an hour after check in because he friend was stuck in traffic. Upon arrival her friend dangled the keys from her car window, didn’t explain anything and said you need help? Almost like it was an issue to actually show the place. I was tired from a day of travel and waiting around. I said no. That was my mistake because if I saw the place I would have jetted first night. I contacted host and told her of the issues, but she thought it was clean and up to standards. The second day, property management asked if I was staying in Airbnb and said it wasn’t allowed. I packed my bags and left. After communicating with host and her friend who was “helping” no one was giving me a response when I asked where to place keys. I waited an hour. I then was told to reach out to another friend and they said to drop off at a bar. It was comical by that point.",en

357488,709193093,2020-11-15,1445258,Jean-Sébastien,"This listing is deceiving. The pictures were taken a long time ago and the place clearly doesn’t look modern or luxurious anymore. Some of the amenities are not available. No walk-in closet for instance, there’s no cable TV, jacuzzi and pool were closed, the gym was most of the time closed too. But the biggest problem I had with the place was related to cleanliness. The apartment was dirty. The trash wasn’t emptied, the place hadn’t been vacuumed, dishes in the cabinets were dirty, the carpets were very stained, and so on. Milena uses a 3rd party to manage the apartment while she is gone and that person works with a cleaning company too, so there is no proper transition between guests, as no one checks the apartment. Milena offered to have the cleaning company come back again, but I didn’t feel comfortable having people in the apartment while I was there and the place should have been cleaned when I arrived anyway. I took several pictures to document the issues and show Milena what needed more attention for future guests. Another major issue I had was the smell of stale tobacco, someone clearly smoked in the apartment before. This is not something I reported, because I didn’t think that anything could be done against it, I just kept the windows open most of the time. After my checkout, Milena blamed me for smoking and requested $3445 as a compensation because the next guests left prematurely due to the smoke smell and the lack of cleanliness. This is clearly dishonest. I’m not a smoker and if someone actually checked the place between guests, that would not happen.  For future guests, I recommend reporting directly any issue with this apartment to Airbnb, in order to avoid this kind of situation. On the plus side, the bed was quite comfortable and the location is perfect. For the rest, I was mostly disappointed and wished I had been more careful before booking a place where I could work from for a few days and relax.",en

She is a Los Angeles treasure and full of amazing history and stories which I encourage all guests to take time to engage in lively conversation. She made me feel immediately comfortable and at home, while respectfully maintaining my privacy and quiet time. Because I was away from my home and own animals for an extended period it was a special treat to have her animals become my family - the dogs were always there to greet me and Charlie was good company during my long writing sessions. The cats are beautifully special and Jennifer's passion for rescuing animals connected to my heart. She works really hard to keep all the animals clean and tidy. My room was a special place, filled brightly with natural light and wonderful old windows that I could open and see a view of downtown LA. Jennifer also extended me use of her dance studio to practice yoga while I trained for my certification. It was very cool to be in the space where she has trained many dancers and to relish the photos from her own amazing dance career.

Easy check-in, even if you arrive late, the staff is very helpful. Everything is very clean, the kitchen is complete, TV room and even a nice patio! I stayed here for 3 weeks and I felt very comfortable. I was sleeping on a 4 beds room with a private bathroom.

Housekeepers were fantastic and made the stay very comfortable.The neighborhood is a bit sketchy.If you have a car, there are street parking but you would have to wake up to move it at 7am or be lucky and park on a side that allows you to sleep in till either 9am or noon.

Be aware, that being a hostel, this is a dorm-like environment, which means sharing bathrooms with people who are not always as considerate in how they leave them as you might hope.  The WiFi here isn't very good, with signals dropping or just non-existent, but I've heard it's being upgraded soon.  All in all, this is a good deal for the money.",en

Great place when being on a budget.,en
404795,1444725,2012-06-09,2173826,Camarie,"First off, Gramercy reminded me more of a house than a hostel. I can say that just how my room was setup and taken care of that Kellie really takes a lot of pride in how it looks. I only met her once, but they were awesome hosts! I even told her it was a very nice place to stay. Honestly anything I co uld need while staying somewhere was there. Towels, linens, ect. It was awesome! Overall I would LOVE to stay here again. I seriously have nothing but amazing things to say about Gramercy. They are awesome :) The crowd there wasn't too exciting..I felt a lot of the people there were older and more businessy...whereas other hostel locations have had more of the younger crowd.The only downside of Gramercy is the location. While it is not too far away from the bus stop..Maybe  a 5 minute walk down to the metro that can take you all (Website hidden by Airbnb) was just in a little bit of a scary part of town. If you are a guy it may not be as of a big deal, but being a small blonde girl- having to work and walk there by myself was an interesting trip every day. I walked as fast as I could and always found friends to take me home at night. It is definitely in the more Spanish part of town. So that really was the only downside of it that I can think of.But I felt as safe as ever inside of Gramercy! Gated and locked. It was definitely a safe place itself :) The internet was great, the beds were..beds, but the storage space for clothes/shoes, ect was awesome! Great stay for the price!",en

411493,1164609,2012-04-22,2091464,Sid,"Stayings at Albert's wonderful Victorian home in Pasadena was amazing. Albert is what I call a extra super host because not only did he cook a delicious breakfast for me, he became a guide taking me around Los Angeles and Pasadena to show me some of the great architecture. He also drove me to the Long Beach airport which is 50 miles round trip for him. By doing this for me it gave me much needed time to shoot photography at the beautiful Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens before my flight home.I always felt safe and very comfortable at Albert's home. His friendly dog was a extra bonus since I'm a dog lover. His attic beadroom is very large. Has great lighting which also has a wonderful breeze of wind in the evening. The color of the walls are painted just right and has decor that fit's the Victorian period without being over the top. The bed was super comfortable with pillows that were just the right comfort for my very tired head. If this attic could talk what great storys it would share.I never felt like I was just a guest in someone's home because Albert made me feel more like a part of his family. So how you know why I call him a extra super host. I would recommend staying with him to anyone that is thinking of a trip to Los Angeles and Pasadena who wants to experience a bit of history while having some of the best hospitality you will ever find. Excellent place to stay I give him 5 stars plus.My trip was short and the only regret I have is that I did not get to shoot photos of his home because of the bright harsh sunny lighting or did I get to shoot a portrait of Albert with his dog Duchess sitting on his great front porch. That will happen on my next trip next winter when its cold and wet here in Oregon and its sunny and warm in Pasadena.",en

He picked us up from Union Station and even on the Rosebowl on the 4th of the July, let us borrow bikes so we could get to the library and was an unlimited source of knowledge. We felt as if we were staying with a friend we had known for years. The room is wonderful, in a gorgeous Victorian house that is looked after with the utmost care.

I thoroughly recommend booking to stay with Albert, in this room or any of the others he has available.

Although I did not see him a lot, he was accessible and hospitable throughout my stay. The room was clean and matched the description well. The mini-fridge, microwave and coffeepot in the room were handy, and access to the well-stocked kitchen on the second floor were perfect for a one-month stay in Pasadena. The house is a bit far from shops, restaurants, etc., but within a few miles’ walk. Albert actually loaned me a bike to help with that.  Uber is an option and the house is relatively close to the metro. A run of cooler temperatures during my stay was an added bonus, so I can’t speak to the comfort of this room during the dog-days of summer. Also, the claw foot tub might be a concern as the tub moved under me while showering. I would certainly recommend and stay again. ",en

The location is great - pretty quiet, safe, near restaurants, bars, a little market, etc. The unit is one of four (I believe) and the neighbors are great. They really helped make me feel at home while I was there. The apartment was very cute and perfect for one or two people. It comes equipped with most everything you need (few pots/pans, some silverware, a few cups, extra sheets, laundry detergent, etc). If I could have added anything I would have added a broom and a microwave (the kitchen is small though, so I understand why there wasn't a microwave). Parking was on the street and very easy no matter what time of day I was getting home. The only issue I ran into was a plumbing issue, twice. That sucked but Bianca worked hard to get it resolved each time and communicated with me the entire time. That is a major plus about Bianca, she was very communicative and reached out several times just to check in on me. I really appreciated that.All in all I would stay at Bianca's place again and was grateful I found it.",en

Very comfortable, with all the amenities of home away from home. The apartment was clean with obvious adherences to Air BnB Covid Hosting protocols, which I really appreciated. Kelly is an attentive Host, checking in throughout my stay to make sure all was well and communication in general was excellent. The kitchen is well-equipped for cooking your own meals, especially if you intend a long or extended stay, so you don't have to eat out or get takeaway all the time. Relaxing is easy on the comfortable sectional right in front of the Roku TV. With a security entrance, I felt safe coming and going in this area of Hollywood which is important. Key Café is a great way to pick up and drop off Kelly's house keys. I enjoyed staying at Kelly's place and I'm sure you will too.",en

She had awesome suggestions regarding vegan food places.  SPACE: The place is spacious and has lots of light.  The room itself does get unbearably hot during the day, as the AC machine is in the living room/kitchen area and does not reach the bedrooms.  It only gets cooler later in the day.  There is an air mattress in the bedroom.  It is comfortable, but you have to fill it out every once in a while.  There is enough closet with space and a dresser.  KITCHEN: Tara was very kind to clear some kitchen cabinets as well as fridge space, so that I could store some food.  I stayed for 39 days, so that was very convenient. PARKING: The parking was very doable.  I never had a problem finding parking.  A few times I did have to look around longer, but found parking a couple of blocks away.  For the most part - and depending on the time of day - I did found a free spot right in front of the building. LOCATION: Tara's apartment is about 4 blocks away from the ""Walk of Fame.""  It was nice to just be able to walk and not deal with parking when taking a touristic walk.  There are also restaurants and coffee shops.  Ralph's is just around the corner and Target and Starbucks are about 3 blocks away.   The overall area is ok.  You have to pay attention when taking a walk as there is plenty of doggy poop on the streets (LOL!).For the most part Tara is away for work, so it is pretty much just you in the apartment.  She still manages to text back if you need anything.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay, and would stay here again in the future. :)",en

The Casita is beach themed, very beautiful and well-maintained, modern, and comfortable. Within just a 3-mile radius you will find any and every store, restaurant, and food type in existence, everything from mom-and-pop to fast-food, banks, grocery stores, the works. It is a cool half-mile walk from the beach, and only 8 blocks away from Sand Dune park which is perfect for kids, walking your dogs, or exercise. Twice monthly House cleaning is included at no extra charge! There’s also a gardener that comes on Saturdays. This was our first time staying with Neva, my wife toy poodle and I. I was hired for a job that required training in LA for 8-12 weeks, and therefore needed a flexible, medium-term solution. I sent Neva a message explaining all the details of our trip, and from the start she was communicative and understanding regarding our needs. When it came time to leave our listing early she changed the reservation right away without any penalties. Neva is very involved with the management of her listing and comes to check on it regularly. She lives only a few blocks away and is available continuously. During check-in she me at her Casita and walked me through the house. I would say that Neva has a lot of rules regarding the use of her property, but she lays them out very clearly in writing and none of them are unreasonable. There are a great number of trees and plants in the front of the house and Neva sends someone to water them every day, either she herself or a kid neighbor. Neva’s listing is also price-marked depending on if you are 1 or 2 people, and generally does not allow dogs, however Neva was great and let my wife and dog to come visit on the weekends at no extra charge. When we wanted to have my wife and dog remain for the duration of my stay, Neva agreed right away to bring them on board at a reduced charge to “keep the family together.” :-) Her property is across the street from a Chevron Refinery, but it is not loud at all and in fact produces a pleasant white noise which makes the neighborhood very peaceful. Street parking is easy to find, but street cleaning on Tuesdays and Fridays means you cannot leave your car unattended when you leave town. Having said that, Neva’s neighbor Nancy, who helps manage the property when Neva leaves town, is an A+ champion and offered us to leave our car parked in her driveway when we needed to. She was also amazing when Manhattan Beach had a power surge and we were left without power, and no point did we feel isolated or un-taken care of because Nancy was there bringing us whatever we need and working with repair people to...",en

Plenty of parking, in an extremely safe cul-de-sac residential neighborhood. As I was moving from the other side of the country I had all of my belongings in my car and in my room and never once did I feel worried or concerned about it. Check-in was easy, I was warmly greeted by one of the hosts and given access to anything I could have possibly needed. I felt right at home here and don't know if any past or future AirBnB experience (within my budget) could top this one. The host was always available for a quick response if anything was needed and made me feel very welcomed as it was my first adventure in California while in search of a permanent home.

Pros: - Location: easy walk to beach and quaint shops and restaurants- Fun goodies: games and useful gadgets to keep a group entertained (full cupboard of board games, lots of video games, dvds, books, cds, outdoor stuff and more)- Spacious: we only had 3 people but the house has beds for 2 couples and a kid comfortably and is spacious to host a good group party (if the hosts would allow). We had my fiancé's mom with us, and the so the separate second house in the back was perfect to allow us some privacy while being in the same household- Very well equipped kitchen: powerful gas range, every pot, pan and tool you can think of, also a kind note from Dawn graciously saying that you may use their food stuff if you like - we borrowed a bit of oil and spices, the little things that are necessary for a good meal but you don't really want to buy just for a meal away from home- Awesome rainfall shower head with strong water pressure (in the back house) Cons:- Hot water - I think the house only has one small hot water tank, so we had to keep the shower on low and take turns showering after I ended up with a cold shower on the first night (pity considering what a fantastic shower they have!)- The kitchen can be a bit cleaner - some of the pans and kitchen stuff like the dish rack were somewhat greasy and gunky. Totally understandable as a part of an evidently well used kitchen in a loving and busy home. However, we were charged $100 for cleaning, so we were somewhat expecting things to be cleaner than requiring a good scrub before using. NB: this is only the kitchen tools that just can't get cleaned that well in a dishwasher. Everything else in the house was very clean and comfortable.- Pillows (the ones on the bed in the back house) felt really thin, old(?) and lacked support.

There are only three bedrooms, but we were able to use their sleeping pads and sleeping bags to accommodate our five boys quite easily.  The location consists of a front house separated by a small courtyard from a converted garage in the back which contains one bedroom and one bath and a large sitting area that opens onto the backyard.  Just note that the converted garage does not have air conditioning, which should only be an issue in really hot weather.

One on the first floor, another on the roof with the pool.The Arts District in LA is interesting in that it's the old industrial area (think SOMA SF) that is being turned into expensive loft apartments. How artists afford those expensive apartments is beyond me but it's called the ""Arts District"". There's lots of trendy restaurants buried in and among all the old warehouses. I'd highly recommend checking out the Zinc Cafe which is just about 1 block from the apartment.You can walk to Little Tokyo and the Little Tokyo metro station is also close by.Minuses, I didn't know where to get any groceries after 10pm (I'm a night owl) and no late night convenience stores near by AFAICT.We had one issue which the listing claimed ""Free Parking on Premises"" and did not include parking what-so-ever. I actually wouldn't have rented it if that had been honestly listed. This is the 3rd time I've had this problem on AirBnB. I really wish they'd do something about it. Riccardo apologized and tried to make up for it and I really didn't have a choice so I had to make due. I'm still not totally happy with that though. Especially since it seems common for AirBnB listings to lie about their amenities.  ",en

Due to travelling on airline staff tickets my family (wife, 2 & 5 yr old) and I needed ultimate flexibility due to possible flight issues, which Stephanie provided (late arrival times and last minute booking).The area of Santa Monica the apartment is in felt very safe, I have lived in London for 15 years and I felt safer there than in some areas of South West London (Twickenham). The first night we kept the windows shut as I had the opinion that Los Angeles is a 'dangerous' city, I have to admit once I understood the area more we slept every night after that with the doors and windows open! The apartment was clean and very presentable, it felt very homely and Stephanie had left a welcome basket with fruit and other nice things to welcome us (this was a nice touch). The apartment has 2 very comfortable double beds, a great shower, huge fridge and a kitchen with all the items you will need.The apartment was in the perfect location for me as it was 5-10 mins from Santa Monica beach, 20 mins from Beverly hills and all the heavy tourist areas, 30 minutes from Malibu (traffic dependent) and 3 minutes from the freeway and access to the whole of LA. Looking back the location was perfect for what we wanted (a bit of everything!). I hired a bike and within 10 minutes of leaving the apartment I was climbing into the Santa Monica Mountains for glorious views of Down town LA through to Pacific Palisades.There are great options of local shops, a large CVS (24 hr opening) 2 blocks away and a lovely Organic Cooperative that stocks items for all, including Lactose free milk and cheeses etc if you're that way inclined 11 blocks.This was the first time I have used airbnb and have to say my experience was excellent. I was worried that there would be always an issues as it wasn't a hotel etc, I was so grateful my experience wasn't this. This in truth was down to Stephanie as she was friendly, flexible, reliable, and so so helpful. In truth she was just the sort of host you need when you are a long way from home. Thanks Stephanie, you have my details and I know we will stay in touch. Many thanks again, Greg and family x p.s I nearly forgot, serious value for money, fully equipped 2 bedroom apartment at a great rate! ",en

I loved that it was so close to whole foods, but it definitely isn't the safest area to be walking around after dark and because it gets dark early at this time of year, it's tough.  The bedroom and attached bathroom were good(I loved the jet tub), but it is a little awkward having all all of the guy's stuff who usually lives there, in the space.  The closet is full of most of his clothes with a section free to hang up your own.  The place smelled overwhelmingly of soap, but I soon discovered it was to cover the smell of marijuana.  The one thing I found very odd was that there is no actual oven.  There is a microwave oven(no microwave), but that doesn't compare to having an actual oven.  The actual host wasn't there when I was, but there were other people there.  They had two very loud parties during my stay and I had to put ear phones in to fall asleep both times.

537943,622423111,2020-04-14,144382622,Debra,"Especially great for longer staysThe best things about this apartment (and the other units Hamid rents) are:1.  Hamid!  He is very responsive!  He takes care of important maintenance issues quickly (usually within a day), even non-urgent things like hand soap, even though we told him he need not venture out immediately during the pandemic.  He also provides many non-essential items we request – everything from a desk, which he got for the previous tenants and we said we’d rather he leave it here than take it out, and a kitchen island on wheels (we’re used to a much larger kitchen, but the island he brought makes meal prep easy for us), to extra kitchen supplies of the types we use (so two can work in the kitchen at once), and even a table for board games (did I mention we stayed here during the pandemic?).  He is also very creative for finding alternate solutions for items he didn’t have (we didn’t want him to purchase non-essentials for us); for example, he put down cardboard on the tile walkway during a rainy stretch when we complained it was dangerously slippery.2.  Storage space!  A large *empty* pantry, with pull-out shelves.  Kitchen cabinets above the counters with 4 easily adjustable shelves in most, and pull-out shelves below the stove.  Bedroom closets with shelves, drawers, and hanger-bars at different heights, making great use of the space available, which is ample.  Plus dressers and other furniture in every room with drawers and/or storage behind doors.  3. Location!  A great walkable neighborhood with grocery stores and restaurants very close by.  Sidewalks everywhere.  For those with dogs, there are patches of grass between the sidewalk and the curb along this and most blocks – in the last place we stayed we had to walk our dogs 2+ blocks away to find grass that belonged to the community/city and not a private house (yes, we clean up after our dogs, but we’re not about to let them pee on someone’s lawn), and within a week our small dog’s paws hurt so badly we had to bring him to a vet who prescribed antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and booties.  But here we need only take them out front – though they’re usually happy to walk a ways here, with the small dog walking on the soft grass most of the time.Other good things about this apartment:- Great natural light.  Most of the “windows” are actually doors (with a rail preventing you from walking out into nothingness) with full height glass.  The bedroom windows are covered with lace that lets light in without letting others see in, and also have thick curtains over them so you can sleep in darkness.- A/C!- Well stocked kitchen includes about a dozen pots and pans in different sizes, a good assortment of cooking utensils and gadgets, and plenty of silverware, plates, bowls, cups, glasses, mugs, etc.- The living room and primary master bedroom are spacious. - Overhead lighting in every room.Now the not-as-good stuff:- The kitchen is small; however, the counter-top cart / island Hamid brought us makes it fully functional for two people to prepare meals together.- Noisy appliances:  the dishwasher, heat, and A/C all make much more than the usual noise, though all of these are most noticeable only in the kitchen.  The washer and dryer sing their happy ending songs longer than you’d expect, and can’t be stopped by powering them off.- The dishwasher is old and doesn’t work super well.  The pot scrubber cycle doesn’t even put water in.  My husband swears it’s the same model his mother had in the early 80s.  1980s.- Although Hamid seems to always have good intentions, he’s not so good at estimating how long things take to do.  When we checked in later than we’d arranged, he was still in the apartment with an assistant “upgrading” the apartment with new décor, and hadn’t cleaned it yet.  When he gives a time he’ll come do some work in the apartment, he’s often much later than that.- The double beds in the smaller master bedroom are old and very noisy.  Hamid put some boards under the mattress which definitely helped with both the noise and the comfort, but they were still noisy and not very comfortable.- There’s some water damage on the floor near most of the window/doors.  OTOH, if the wood floors were pristine, we’d feel badly about having dogs there.- There are no screens on the patio doors or “window” doors.  However, there aren’t too many bugs around here so it’s not a big problem.Overall, a great place to stay!",en

565733,1956814,2012-08-12,1962171,First Name,This was our second experience with airbnb and we were looking for something a little different this year. When 'House in Hollywood hills with pool' came online we knew this was it! We were not disappointed. Contact with the owners was very easy throughout. The key was left with helpful neighbours and detailed written information was exchanged via email so we felt confident from the start. The house is all it claims to be. Very easy to manage. We really felt at home and relaxed immediately into the wonderful setting...close to all the action but up in the hills above the city in a  very safe neighbourhood. We even saw a deer in the garden! The pool made all the difference and sets this property apart from many we had previously considered. A car is essential if you rent this property as it is  for a stay in Los Angeles no matter where you are. We enjoyed trips into the city and beyond (San Diego zoo) as well as days lazing around the pool doing nothing! This property accommodates 4 adults comfortably. The kitchen is well equipped and the barbecue on the terrace is a great addition for dinner al fresco! We would certainly consider this property again if we visit LA. Loved it! D&A,en

If you can afford the price, we highly recommend it. Stanley is very friendly and helpful, and he lives next door in case you need him for anything.BASICS: Nice size master bedroom with attached bathroom (with a great bath), plus a second bathroom with shower. Comfy firm queen bed, decent closet space. Smaller second bedroom with full-size bed. Washer/dryer/dishwasher is great. Kitchen is okay for cooking, though it could use a few more basic tools and appliances. The PARKING SPACE is so great to have, avoiding dealing with street parking is a dream.LOCATION: Great location, half a block to Abbot Kinney, very safe neighborhood. Easy walk to Gjelina, Salt n Straw, MTN, Intelligentsia, Blue Bottle, Adidas, Erowhon market, etc. But it was still very quiet at night, as it's tucked away from the main street.YARD: The backyard is INCREDIBLE, like a botanical garden, filled trees and flowers and more variety of cacti than I knew existed. Chairs to sit in and relax in the shade. There are also several table options for outdoor eating/working, including a large space that feels like a local cafe all to yourself.FOR BABY: The house, for the most part, is baby friendly, with a few sharp corners to watch out for. We had to bring our own pack n play, and high chair. The master bathroom was perfect for bath time (For a 10-month old. Watch out the water gets VERY hot!). Washer and dryer is great to have, obviously. Our son LOVED exploring the backyard but we had to be careful with all the prickly cacti. It's walkable to plenty of parks and things, and there are baby classes and play groups nearby.",en

565836,497774769,2019-07-28,2233806,Darren,"The only two words to appropriately describe this AirBnb rental are TOTALLY AMAZING! It’s hosts like Stanley and his wife Susie and properties like this that make the desire to stay at even the finest hotels a thing of the past. The house is quaint yet not small it has a very open and warm feeling, I would say it’s the perfect size. The shower water pressure is incredible and the house is a sanctuary of peace and solitude just walking distance from Venice beach. The owners wife, a former landscape designer has spun her magic with a fully developed stunning and enchanted private garden/courtyard that is frankly hard to pull yourself away from. But you will because behind the gates of this home is one of the greatest shopping, food,  and young creative art streets LA has to offer, Abbot Kinney Boulevard and should you desire to venture further your at the Venice boardwalk where you can bicycle or rollerblade trails connecting you North all the way to Malibu or South to Redondo Beach. If waking up in a stunningly beautiful and peaceful refuge steps away from all the best stuff LA has to offer sounds like your cup of tea I suggest you quickly push that “book” button if your lucky enough to find this property is actually available.",en

I was blown away by how beautiful the space and grounds were (pictures will never be able to do it justice). You can tell that a lot of love and thought went into it. It felt like my home away from home. The beds are very comfortable, Shower pressure was perfect and the giant TV in the living room with Netflix was a big plus. I fell in love with the beautiful tile in the kitchen. They had everything I needed for cooking as well. I often have to go out and get supplies when staying somewhere but they had everything I needed.The location was amazing. Right behind Abbot Kinney and a quick walk to Rose Ave where there are great restaurants. Being from NY, it was very important to me to have an area that was walkable. I was nervous about the area before my stay but there wasn’t one moment that I felt unsafe in the house or area. Stanley and his wife were the highlight of this home. They are incredibly kind and  accommodating. My biggest regret is not finding time to barbecue with them and get to know them more. This home is so special. I highly recommend to rent this magical space for your visit to Venice. It is the perfect Venice bungalow.",en

The house is very special, Stanley and his wife have put much care into making sure it’s comfortable and well stocked for everything you might need during your stay.

Place was tastefully decorated. Very comfortable.   Didn't swim, but dipped my toes in and pool seemed warm.  She got back to me super quickly whenever I reached out.  The only thing that was slightly unfortunate was that there is water rationing in L.A. because of the drought so the lawn was more yellowish than the picture--but a green lawn would have been in bad taste, as everywhere in L.A. is like that now!

It is such a comfortable, beautiful place with nice touches - it was perfect for us, a family of four.Now, when we booked, we were a bit worried that the sleeping situation (the kids being in the living room) might be an issue, but that was not the case at all, since the apartment is so spacious. When the kids were sleeping, we were actually sitting on the terrace, which is also really spacious. we always had breakfast and the occasional dinner out there, too (but there is another dining table in the living room, too).The kitchen had everything we needed - and on our arrival, we found even some bagels, cream cheese, apples, water, and coffee for us - which was highly appreciated and saved our first morning. Debbie is such a wonderful host!! Communicating was very easy, she answered quickly, and check-in was no problem at all, although we arrived in the middle of the night. Everything was prepared for us. The pool is simply...fantastic! It is really big, very clean, we all had so much fun in it!And the location? Well, what can I say?

The studio itself was very comfortable and had what you'd need for a long stay. It seems like it's a converted garage so it's attached to the main house on one wall, but it's a totally separate space, and you come and go through the backyard. The furnishings are a little worn, but very comfy! Great bed, good shower, good couch. The location is great for getting around - really convenient to get to all different areas in LA, but particularly close to Venice and Santa Monica. Parking was pretty easy as well: I was always able to find a spot on that street or around the corner. The door to the studio faces the living room of Michelle's house, but there's blinds, and I felt like I had plenty of privacy. Rarely interacted with the family beyond a friendly smile and wave if I saw them in passing (though Michelle messaged me to check in and was quick to respond if I reached out for anything!). They do have a dog, who is very sweet once she gets to know you, but she does bark when she's out in the yard and would sometimes bark at me as I was coming and going if she was out (but just barking, as dogs do!). The patio - which is right outside the door to the place was great. It's currently under a shady canopy, but I pulled the couch out so I could sit in the sun. It's an outdoor space, so it's a little dirty, with the leaves and whatnot, but easy enough to just brush off, and great to be able to move from sun to shade and back if you want to sit out there for a while. Oh and the wifi worked well while sitting out on the patio. I didn't cook much, but the little kitchen had the basics that you'd need. I was here in the winter, so can't speak to how hot it gets in there, but was always comfortable with the temperature. It got cold overnight, but there are two space heaters that warmed up the room and kept things at a comfy temperature. The TV and the table/chairs are both upgraded from what's currently in the pictures. It's a large, flat screen TV (with full cable and movie channels), and cushier chairs at the table. Overall, I'd definitely recommend Michelle's place.",en

Their profile of their place in Laurel Canyon lived up to the description and more. The beds were comfortable, showers and bathrooms had all the amenities that you would need. Their house was enchanting - being the home of two singers/songwriters/performers. Their cat Grace was a delight. They have all the things you need to have a home away from home, including onsite laundry!! Central air was so nice after hot LA day. Their yard and hot tub were a treat! Private and serene! And the neighborhood is so cool - atop a mountain, trails lead you to views of all of LA! We had a parking space too. It was only a 5-10 minute trip in car to awesome restaurants and shopping in West Hollywood. Also Whole Foods and CVS wee only 10 min away. I Highly recommend their place for couples or families!

Many of the drawers are filled with variables of things that felt like people living here for a long time before we came. And they rushed out. The spa was good and clean, and the bed looks clean (even though the bedside drawers are all filled which reduces the feeling of cleanness). Too many house rules that felt like the guests are somewhat as a part of their clean team. Too close to neighbors. Anywho, good place but not worth the money.",en

Parking is tough on the road but we found a slot behind the apt.  The room in the front is not as light as in the photo and you cannot open the blinds...the window opens on to an alley and your privacy is compromised.

If you are interested in doing the touristy things like Hollywood Walk of Fame and Universal Studios, those can be done from the Metro so easily, just a couple stops away. The neighborhood was super cute, quiet, and a perfect place to call home for our 7-week stay. We also had a 3rd person staying with us and there was more than enough space for all of us.

634390,2839677,2012-11-08,2498605,Mark,"Have been browsing through airbnb for some time now, had been a bit hesitant since it was something entirely different than going the hotel route. There are many nice-looking places that got me curious... So, I decided to give one a try for our short trip to Los Angeles. It took my  wife some convincing since she was not as adventurous... It was also a good thing we used to live in Los Angeles, and knew our way around and where exactly we wanted to be close to. This modern condo would be considered, located in ""the Valley"" which is close enough to the famed Hollywood area and a few other attractions, but would be quite a drive from the Disneyland and Adventure parks towards the South... but this is where we knew we wanted to be. It was right smack center onto Warner Center, which is where my wife and I find ourselves doing our shopping and all the familiar restaurants we would frequent... It was simply perfectly located for us. The condo is a well-secured property with very conveniently located garages leading up to elevators and passageways onto the units itself. Walking is not as common in LA, but I assure you, everything is within a few steps. The Westfield Topanga Mall is our attraction in this side of town, and I assure you there are tons to do and see that will surely take up most of your day. Geerat was just the perfect host, providing everything we needed, even directions and a mini handbook with pictures on how everything works. He definitely put a lot of time into doing this, and made sure of every detail. Prior to arriving, I had inquired with Geerat about his wifi connections and TV cable. He regret to inform me that he hadn't been watching too much TV that he didn't see the need to have cable. When we arrived, he surprised me and already had HD cable programming. WOW!!! But how can you not have cable with that huge and awesome ""Smart TV"" in your living room...

634390,8562275,2013-11-05,2498605,Mark,"This is my favourite place to stay! It's just too bad that someone had reserved the week after I arrived which made us cut our stay shorter than we had wanted. It just goes to show how popular or convenient this place is... Discovered another awesome thing about this place too, it is just the perfect location to do a lot of cycling. You can just hop on your bike from the condo, and there are lots of bike lanes which would get you to just about anywhere. I was able to find a nice route all the way to Agoura Hills, Westlake Village and onto Thousand Oaks. It is also just minutes away from the Santa Monica Mountains which is also a very popular route along with Mulholland Hwy. You can also head North via Valley Circle Dr. and that will get you to Northridge and North Hills onto Santa Susana. His condo can speak for itself, as you can see from the photos. But really, Geerat leaves his place stacked with beers (a wide variety), and even cookies and frozen foods. The new thing that my wife really LOVED was the Nespresso machine!The Westfields Mall has also improved, and updated their stores and restaurants... Ventura Blvd. always has a wide variety of choices from bike shops, coffee shops, restaurants, etc.Anyways, all I can say is.... Geerat, you will definitely see me again in the very near future! Hopefully, early next year. I hope nobody beats me to the reservation.",en

Teresa and Nassim were very prompt to answer my request and to make everything ready for my parents with a one-day notice, so Thank You for that! It was very nice and easy to communicate with them about the details and they made the keys available for pick up anytime, which was great as I wasn't sure of when my parents would arrive.Here is the review they wrote after their stay:The house is charming and the room we had was neat with a nice view. A cup of coffee in the morning would have been appreciated, as well as some soap and shampoo in the room. The description of the place should also have indicated that a single bathroom is to be shared by the occupants of 4 separate rooms. This worked out ok though for us as the other tenants were earlier birds than us.Actually during the three nights we spent in the house, we met nobody in the house, neither the owner nor the other tenants. Only lights being turned on and morning shower noises indicated some human presence, which was kind of weird. The only human touch was a hand-written note on a bag of donuts one morning saying ""please help yourself"". In summary, this is not what we would call a B&B but just a B, or a room with a view.",en

I could use the Chromecast to watch my favorite movies. The view is AMAZING!!!!!! During the day, I had a spectacular view of downtown and even a peak of the Hollywood sign. I experienced an incredible sunset with the entire sky turning pink and orange from the top balcony. The buildings all light up the night sky.Did I mention how convenient the house is located? I was just minutes down Broadway to downtown. It was also super easy to hop on the 5 or the 110 – freeways. I only stayed one night so I didn’t have time to cook in the inviting kitchen or eat in the original dining room but both looked beautiful.

On our initial tour of the house she carefully went over every detail so I can maximize my stay and fully utilize what was available (filtered water, laundry, etc).  She even had a little map of local markets and shops.  The neighborhood is very nice.  I felt safe throughout my stay.  Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to utilize the kitchen but everything you need to make a meal is there.   The house is as described and the photos are accurate.

Nancy was an excellent host, showing us the ropes, then leaving us alone. The house is roomy, comfortable, and well-stocked. Downtown Monrovia is an easy two-block walk away, a walk that we made frequently for the restaurants, groceries, post office, and library. The residential neighborhood is also great for walking, full of craftsman houses to admire. The bed in the bedroom was comfortable--there's a futon couch/bed in the living room which we used as a couch rather than bed. The kitchen is spacious--we appreciated the well-stocked cupboards, the in-kitchen table, and the water dispenser that we filled with water processed through Nancy's special water filter. Good water!We were not bothered so much by the noise of the garbage trucks (see earlier review). It's only once a week, and only every other weeks that the recycling trucks also go through. I was working at home all day, and found it a quiet and peaceful place to be. The living room is big enough that my workplace at the desk at one end and the seating area for conversation and TV at the other end felt nicely separated.My husband and I even managed to get in some horn and piano duets since there's the added bonus of a spinet piano in the living room. Unfortunately, I only discovered the drawer full of piano music in the desk on the last day of our stay!All in all, the house was lovely, cozy, homey in a wonderful location. We'd go there again any time.",en

Alexa was cool to have :) I was surprised to have sugar, flour, olive oil, a bunch of spices, and other condiments. It was definitely a nice touch. PS4 worked perfect for the kids as well as having electric scooter, all sorts of board games, cards and books. Beds were all comfortable and linens were clean. There were plenty of towels for the pool. It was awesome to have a large, as our kids called it ""raft"" to play in the pool on top of water guns and other pool relates toys. The backyard was AWESOME. It was lash with greens, had very nice lights at night (for ambiance), very thoughtful during space and for pit. The owners were super! They comminated immediately and were very helpful. It was especially touching that we were allowed to leave later without extra fee even though it was our fault we screwed up the date of departure (it happens to the best of us ).

If you're looking for a place to get away during the pandemic- look no further than Pete's place since you'll have everything you need here minus groceries (which are only a short walk or drive away). I highly recommend staying at Pete's place for anybody or any family. It's really a dream come true.",en

The tv room was a nice hangout for the kids when they needed some chill time, lots of books for all ages as well. Backyard was the best part! Swings, scooters, and of course the pool! I paid extra fee for gas heating the pool and im so glad i did, it was perfect temperature the entire stay and the kids enjoyed it everyday, nice big wading area with covered umbrella so i could sit with the baby and watch the older kids. Even had floaty and pool toys! Lots of outdoor seating options as well. Pete was extremely nice, very quick to respond to any questions and made sure we had everything we needed. Would absolutely book again if back in the area!",en
674784,384845519348617670,2021-06-14,29540488,Gbers,"A five star experience! This home is wonderful value for the money and GREAT for families with kids. Lots of child-friendly activities/toys/accessories—an upright piano, electric scooter, swings, board games, a robust library to meet the needs of every reading level—to name a few. The host, Pete, must be quite the movie buff as the family’s collection of classic and new DVD’s is quite impressive (and, of course, available to guests). I especially loved that the kitchen was so well stocked with plates, utensils, cooking supplies, etc. The beds were mostly comfy, providing a good night’s sleep. Location is quite convenient, as the house is located near supermarkets and major highways. Without traffic, we easily accessed most neighborhoods of LA in 20 minutes flat. Getting to the Getty Museum was a cinch; even driving to the Getty Villa in Malibu was an unexpectedly beautiful and scenic route. In non-COVID times, we would have taken advantage of the location to go to the Zoo and Universal Studios. Communicating with the host was quick, reliable and easy. I appreciated his willingness to respond to our requests and offer solutions the few times we needed assistance. We rarely saw the resident in the back house but when we did run into her, she was a delight and super friendly. A couple of tips if you plan on staying in their wonderful home: 1) be sure take a walk around the neighborhood to get to know the area; it’s totally safe and walkable to stores (fro-yo, supermarkets, etc). Ride the electric scooter or the skate board! 2) bring insect repellent if you are planning on spending lots of time out back. there are some generic bugs—to be expected from the lush landscaping. 3) try popular Porto’s Bakery in Burbank (10 minute drive) for breakfast/lunch/dinner. Valley Village also offers some amazing taco options (mostly open for dinner).",en

681142,3234173,2013-01-02,140726,William,"This is a great place in a very convenient location. Gisele and her partner were very attentive to my particular scheduling needs. Unlike other Airbnb hosts, Gisele was very quick to respond to emails and answer any questions I had. I didn't get to meet Gisele, but her partner showed me the beautiful home and was able to change our meeting time a couple of times due to my tardiness. I had informed Gisele that I was going to have a romantic dinner for the night I was booking the room. Gisele and her partner arranged the condo in a such a way to set the right mood with great lighting and even provided us with a bottle of wine. Things to remember if you want to stay here: bring your own firewood if you want to use the fireplace. This is something I would have liked to have done, but we didn't realize we had to purchase our own firewood. Also, the jacuzzi works wonderfully, but remember to bring your own materials if you want to have an ideal bubbly time. Last, cats regularly live at this location, so if you are allergic, please be aware. I know I missed this fact in the description, so I ended up with some allergies.",en

A very comfortable place to stay, with everything you'd need at hand, in a nice quiet neighbourhood. If you have a car (essential for LA), the location is perfect for freeway access, and you can usually park directly outside the house, otherwise there are always spaces on the neighbouring streets. It's also worth noting that there's a street light close by, so you can feel safe entering & leaving the house at night.Phil himself was very friendly & helpful, not that I needed his help because there were no problems with the house!As other people have noted, this place is very convenient for the life & amenities of North Hollywood. Even closer at hand I can recommend Tacos Manzano (for all your Taco needs) & The California Institute of Abnormalarts (a unique freakshow/bar/musical experience), both on Burbank Blvd, and the Chandler Bikepath starting at Vineland/Chandler for those wanting somewhere peaceful to run.Overall, thoroughly recommended, and I'd be more than happy to stay there again.",en

The stove is quaint and fits the “theme” of the house but really needs to be updated. The gas burners are not secured and there’s no way to know when the oven reaches temp, or if it even does.  I cooked on the stove  and used the oven once and then never touched it again. I did not feel safe using it all during our 3 month stay.  The a/c needs major updating. The two wall units in the bedrooms are just not enough to adequately cool the house down for the hot summer months. It made sleeping at night kind of miserable.

The decor and furnishings are tasteful, and combined with the excellent corner-unit views, and abundant all-day sunlight, it's like a zen retreat.  Further, José made great efforts to make sure that I had all of the necessary amenities available for a comfortable visit (towels, soaps, coffee, etc.).The location of the building is ideal for exploring downtown Long Beach, and was within walking distance of nearly anything one might want to do while visiting.  The building and the area around it felt very safe, and appropriately residential, despite being in the heart of the city.Again, José was a tremendously thorough and welcoming host--his detailed preparation left me with no questions, and no stress.When visiting Long Beach in the future, I would consider it a treat to get to stay in José's place again.",en

I also met a few neighbors who seemed very nice.  This is an old building with incredible charm, and Jose's apartment has a wonderful view of the Queen Mary.Jose had stocked the place with fruit, yogurt and wine for my enjoyment, which I did.  While I was by myself on business, this would have been a perfect place for a couple.  I had my associate and his wife over for wine one night and they were very jealous of my accommodations.5 stars for Jose and his wonderful place.

He even had aBowl of fresh fruit, yogurt, granola, OJ, and milk for us. I was traveling with my 12 year old daughter and felt very safe. The building is very old. The lobby, hallways and elevator (very small) are not the most inviting but the actual unit is self was very spacious and nicely updated.

I was not told that the kitchen floor would be used as the cat and or dog's restroom. I chose this particular Airbnb because there was a fully functioning kitchen for me to use, however the odor, sight and location of the feces made it uncomfortable and unsanitary. Two young males at one point were given access to the house while Christal was absent. I was not given a heads up and Christal was unaware that the guys would ""maybe"" stay the night. They arrived at 7pm and didn't leave until past midnight. The host did not address me about it afterwards.

The bedroom is super tidy, and most importantly the bed is ULTRA comfortable, and Christal has put blackout-type curtains on the window. Hence, the room here is great for resting well! Additionally, as noted in the description, you have a bathroom to yourself and are basically isolated in your own hallway wing of the house. All in all this is a great place to stay. The area didn't have all the restaurant choices that I was used to in Canoga Park (more vegetarian-friendly locals out there), but the neighborhood feels very safe and is way off of the main streets which is great.",en
719115,442935468,2019-04-24,34907834,Nick,"Christal's home is a wonderful stay. You essentially get your own wing of the home, including separate, personal bathroom. Her home is extremely clean at all times (and you're expected to keep the common spaces that way, as all guests should!). Shower & hot water are a good pressure - not always a given! And the neighborhood is very safe, very quiet, and parking is ample.A few things to be aware of, however: While it did not bother my wife & I too much, her wonderful cat uses a pee-pad which is in the kitchen, instead of a litter box elsewhere. It gets changed daily, but it might be off-putting to some folks, depending. Both her cat & dog are great pets though and very friendly. No litter-box smell is the bright side of that equation. Additionally, just know that Christal is very busy with her own work and life, and she'll likely not have time or interest in connecting with guests most of the time. Just set your expectations there, and it's not an issue. She's perfectly communicative via the AirBnb messaging. So, as long as you're not looking for your host to hang out with you and talk about all your LA experiences, give you tons of recommendations and the like, Christal is a perfectly kind host while you're in her home. The bed was super comfortable, kitchen stocked with fine cooking gear, and the typical amenities all available and clean & well stocked. Definitely recommend staying with Chrsistal.",en

722233,249200250,2018-04-01,178701511,Jan,"We stayed at Steven & Judy's apartment the last week of March 2018.  The communication, check-in, apartment cleanliness, location, and parking were excellent.  The apartment is as pictured.  The kitchen is well stocked (even coffee!).  Lots of pots, pans, glasses, etc.  Laundry in the apartment.  Location is great - we walked to the beach, restaurants, shopping etc.  Also, it is a huge asset to have parking on-site, as parking can be a challenge in this area. I hate to mention anything negative, but I depend on these reviews when making my reservations so want to mention all.  I did not realize there would be tenants above us (my mistake when booking).  The first day we arrived, there was a car in our parking spot (not too big of a deal as we met the renters above and they moved their car), but the noise they made was a very big deal.  I'm not sure, but we saw a minimum of 6 people and the music and smoke was at times unbearable.  We were traveling with our 20 yr old son and two of his college friends and they even thought the music was loud & annoying.  After the renters above moved out, a family with young children moved in and the noise above did not stop.  We are thinking they were bouncing balls as the thumping and jumping was non-stop.  I didn't contact Steven about this as we only had two days until we checked out, but again, unfortunate.  Minor nuisances:  the screen door on the outdoor patio off the master was broken off and the ice maker did not work.  We never met Steven or Judy, but they seemed very kind.  Overall a decent stay.",en

The only off-putting thing that happened was the host came to our unit to change a battery on our door, which was not communicated to us beforehand. The host let himself in as my fiancé was walking to the door. It made us really uncomfortable especially since all our work stuff and valuables were out, which my fiancé let him know in the moment. A little strange since they could have easily messaged and gave us notice, but we never noticed anything else that indicated they had been in the unit or came in when we weren't there. Probably assumed no one was there after knocking and thought they could do it quick. Unfortunately, they got caught that time. I truly don't believe they had bad intentions, but still worth noting as a potential issue of privacy and security.",en

We immediately noticed that the entire house was clean, newly renovated, and beautifully decorated . We were also greeted with a generous and delicious fruit basket upon arrival.  Because we would be cooking a Thanksgiving dinner for 10, our gracious and generous hosts Howard and Jacqui helped us make sure we had enough chairs and cooking equipment. In fact, they made sure we always had everything we needed, and were always available to answer questions and offer advice. The location is excellent—convenient and safe, on a quiet tree-lined street with available parking, and within walking/running distance to the ocean.  The beds (including the sofa bed in the living room) were incredibly comfortable—soft sheets and a memory foam mattress on the sofa bed.  The koi pond just outside the living room window was a delight to look at, and the burbling sounds of the water were soothing and relaxing.  We had a fabulous Thanksgiving holiday filled with fun family memories, and will always be grateful to Jacqui and Howard for making Zen Cottage a central part of it.",en

It is welcoming, comfortable, and well appointed.  The kitchen has everything one needs and more.  The bathroom was complete with extras, like toothpaste.  The place was spotless when we arrived, so it was easy to feel at home immediately.  And the patio was delightful since it is enclosed an quiet in the busy city.

We took a quick look around the cottage and were thrilled at how lovely and immaculate it was. Then we met Jacqui and she was so charming and welcoming that crazy as it might sound, we felt comfortable asking her to safeguard the wedding gown in her home next to the cottage while we went out to lunch. Later in the day, our 26 year old son arrived and said, ""Nice digs!"" Jacqui and Howard hope to live in the cottage one day and their intent is evident in the design details, quality of fixtures and furnishing. No expense was spared and their creativity shows throughout. We enjoyed breakfast on the secluded patio and gazed at the koi pond through the living window. The kitchen had granite counters and every appliance we could have asked for as well as staples such as olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Though the neighborhood is not the prettiest, we felt safe at all times. We'd go back to the cottage in a heartbeat. ",en

723906,727749971,2021-01-30,74552753,Elaine,"I stayed at Howard and Jacqui's home for one month - to wfh in a location that would be fun and have some sun.  I am familiar with LA so knew exactly where there home was located, and knew it would be accessible to many restaurants, stores and the beach, but away enough from the hustle and bustle.  Due to Covid-19, I chose to stay at an AirBnB home, rather than a hotel or an AirBnB condo because I was concerned about cleanliness, too much traffic from visitors as well as having a kitchen so that I can cook.  While staying there, I also quickly learned another benefit of renting a home during COVID was that I could easily get deliveries (e.g., amazon, groceries, food, etc.) brought right to your doorstep.With my first night I checked in - Howard and Jacqui were so warm and welcoming (more to come on these two great hosts!).  The home was absolutely perfect, and they did a great job with the design and décor of the home.  For example, there is a skylight that you can open/close with a touch of a button.After checking in I noticed they had a welcome basket of fruit and chocolates, which was a nice treat after a flight.  As I stayed there, I discovered more thoughtful touches throughout the home.  For example, they had all new packages of soap, shampoo, conditioner, make up removal wipes and hand lotion.  Having these items brand new/disposable was super important, especially with my concerns with covid and making sure everything is clean.  I also appreciated how they stocked everything with nicer quality products, from the dishwashing soap and laundry soap they were all brands I would use at home.  They even had nicer paper products (e.g., napkins, toilet paper, paper towels, etc.) with extra supplies in the cabinets in case you run out.  This may sound minor, but it’s these little things that make you feel at home and you can see the extra steps taken for the guest's comfort.  To make this review easy to read, I will make the rest in bullet points:WiFi: As I was wfh, I was concerned about wifi speed.  There was absolutely no issue, and even better than some of the hotels I have stayed at previously.  The wifi was so great, I was able to work outside on video conference calls on their picnic bench (with an umbrella!).  Beds: Similar to other reviews, you will have a great night sleep.  Their bed, linens and pillow were so comfortable.  They thoughtfully have another set already clean and ready to go, if you need to change them.  TV:  I am not a TV person, but their TV was amazing, easy to use, and available in each of the rooms.  If you have streaming subscriptions, you can just login and pick up to watch.Convenience and cleanliness: I can go on and on, about all the wonderful touches and how they really made it convenient for the guest (e.g., cleanliness, great gas stove, power strip, birthday candles – yes birthday candles).  I won’t give away all the little nice touches, so that other guests can also be pleasantly surprised too.Kitchen/Kitchen ware: The kitchen was well stocked with all the equipment, tableware and glassware you need (yes there are two ways to make coffee, and grind your own beans).  I was so happy to see a disposable oven tray (with a lid), where I was able to make my lasagna, store it, then toss the mess.  As a Korean American, I still need to get my Asian food fix. I was also happy to see other equipment like a rice cooker, slow cooker and chopsticks that you normally don’t get anywhere else.Keyless entry:  This may sound again simple, but having a keyless entry (keypad), was super convenient.  I would go out for quick walks with my dog throughout the day, and did not have to carry anything with me or worry about losing the key.Hosts:  Saving the best for last.  Howard and Jacqui (and Maya – their new puppy) were amazing hosts.  They were very warm, welcoming and helpful.  Even though they live next door, I still felt I had my privacy, but knew they also were responsive to any text/email I sent if I had any questions, or had to borrow anything.  They also surprised me with a hot pizza that they made from their Italian woodfire pizza oven (delicious!).",en

My first ever negative AirBnB review:1. Bugs. The apartment was not clean. Floors and countertops were dirty, dusty, and sticky. I found bugs crawling through drawers, on walls, even behind sofa cushions. I had to do a thorough cleaning myself.2. Noise. There are several dogs on the floor that bark almost nonstop throughout the day. 3. Lack of privacy. The apartment manager contacted us multiple times (including calls/texts on the weekend) to schedule viewings for prospective tenants during our stay. My husband and I declined and voiced our concerns. The apartment manager and host insisted. (A very recent change to AirBnB now allows hosts to have viewings during a guest's stay, in line with LA county law--a change so recent that not all AirBnB help were aware of it when I asked for guidance.) The apartment manager was on vacation and the host was traveling, thus not available to show the apartment, so my husband had to come home from work early to let the prospective tenant in.",en

Public areas are very clean and modern.  It is very convenient from the tandem (two in a row) parking spaces to the elevator and down the hall to her unit.

In the room there was a mini fridge, coffee maker, and microwave, he also placed some starbuck frapps, diet cokes, water bottles, cup-o-noodles, chocolate, two apples and oranges in the room for us to consume, at no extra cost!When I first saw the snacks in the room I was happy tear into them after a long ride getting there, but then I was concerned this would be like a hotel mini bar kind of thing, so we asked to be sure it was included in the price of the room.As pictured there is a small couch in the room, with a flat screen tv, and a laptop that you can use.   The bed is very firm, good for people with bad backs.  He had towels there for us to use, but we had brought our own with us, just in case.Here is a tip for you: to activate the shower in the bathroom you pull down on the bottom part of the faucet.  i wasn't able to figure that out, so Steve showed me how it needed to be done.Steve had us park our car in the driveway, to ensure we wouldn't have any problems parking in the street.  The place is easy to find. with an Asian plaza nearby.Steve speaks English and Mandarin Chinese, he was super nice during our time there, and I fully recommend staying here",en

With all kinds of business in the neighborhood, supermarket, banks, restaurants and Starbucks are within minute's reach. Steve's house is well facilitated with center-control air-conditioner, independent washroom and kitchen. He provides me with towels, shampoo and even free snacks which makes me feel at home.

741790,4910361,2013-06-01,2824843,Lp,"Arrived to call the number stated and the wife answered (a cell phone). I thought it would be Mr. Huang's cell phone. Mr. Huang wasn't home when I checked it. Only one home was Sandia, his wife. I'm grateful b/c I got to stay at another rental location the couple had, not the one posted. The room was large, two twin size beds adjacent to make a big bed, a desk w/ a computer that they said I could use (but I didn't), television w/ regular TV, but the remote doesn't work well, even though the battery was changed and I needed to turn on and off the tv w/ out using the remote. They let me use the fridge, kitchen and their utensils. The non coin operated washer and dryer I got to use, which looked fairly new.  It was just me, the couple (Mr. & Ms. Huang) and another part time tenant. At night time you have to move your car into the drive way b/c parking permits are required in that area, which was slightly onerous, b/c the gate remote remained in the house and one has to park so as not to block the car exiting the garage and the availability for the part time tenant to enter and exit his car. The wife plays the piano and violen, which I thought was great. Sometimes they had visitors, not noisy though. The house is located adjacent to an elementary school and a main street close to the 10 West so expect traffic. The closest reasonable grocery store is 99 Ranch and on Main Street , Alhambra is Ralphs as the 2nd closest. The Arco station is near by. The toilet seat was loose, but when I requested repair,  Mr. Huang repaired it the same day. The bathroom was big and update. I loved the shower water pressure. They gave me privacy so I could do my school work which was great. It was a 4 bed room house. There are lots of asian food and drink places open late (past 10pm), which was expected considering it's San Gabriel Valley. They're a nice and slightly gregarious couple. The wife does Tai Chai and yogo, which she invited me to, she's so nice. The microwave is big. Kitchen has an island. Sandia offered for me to use their hot water kettle, but I didn't use it. Overall, I'm satisfied. ",en

Parking can be a little annoying but it's still convenient.The area is perfect, having a ton of restaurants to choose from in walking distance and two markets.

The location of this place is very convenient though, close to a park, groceries, bus stops. The rooms are quite dirty, only the main things like bed and floor are cleaned or just the surface stuff. When I arrived I had to buy cleaning products to make it a clean suitable environment for me as I am a germaphob. The host is kind, his English isn't very well but I guess it's enough but when I needed help I wasn't able to get it because he could not understand well. But he was willing to help and be notified if I needed anything. During my stay it was still under construction so there was some noise and unsanitary areas. Overall it's an okay stay.

I was inconvenienced in a major way because I had to move to a hotel because I couldn't book another Airbnb on the same day that I checked into that one.  On top of that, the toilet didn't flush properly and it was just a bad experience all around. I feel bad writing this review, but it's the truth and I don't want anyone else to experience the drama and trauma that I did.  My hope is that 2Best will be honest with himself about his home. He needs to fix his roach problem before renting out anymore rooms. Roaches are filthy creatures and they carry disease. Someone could become very sick if he's not careful.",en

The Living room has comfortable couches, spring chairs and a convenient coffee table / foot rest.  TV and WiFi were great.   Outside the building, there is a shared lawn area with a new gas grill and seating area. It's great to have the flexibility of grilling and eating outside.   The kitchen was modern and well stocked with cookware as well as spices paper towels, trash bags etc. There is a dishwasher, microwave, coffee and tea pots etc.The dining area had a modern table that sat 6 comfortably.   The bathrooms were modern and clean.   Having a garage was great in a town where parking is at a premium. When we had guests, both cars could fit inside the garage.    The bedrooms were comfy with good sized closets. The beds were comfortable. On occasion, you can hear the people above walking around.   It has a great location - being only 1 1/2 blocks from the ocean and just a quick walk to all the restaurants on Washington Blvd and the Venice Pier. Galleon Street is clean and quiet.

The neighbourhood is welcoming, too: Central, less than 5 minutes to the beautiful beach by car, 10 to downtown Santa Monica, yet extremely calm, skylit nights with crickets chirping, only some faraway airtraffic sounds to remind you you`re in a hyperurban area. The bungalow is well equipped, DirecTV, sound system, cozy couch, extremely nice wooden floors. Kitchen and bathroom are great too, in perfect condition, good kitchen appliances, great oven. Very good, big bed, I slept like a stone, absolutely no noise from the surroundings. The patio is a real highlight, too, small, yet personal and private, sunshine til mid-afternoon. It was awesome to have breakfast there each day, perfect holiday feeling! I didn`t personally meet James, the landlord, as he was out of town, but everything from handover of keys to checkout went absolutely smoothly and I felt very welcome.

It had all the necessaries for being at home and cooking (outdoors in the garden included), though I didn’t cook much. It is also very well located in residential Santa Monica, and only a few blocks from entrances to the Santa Monica Freeway (10), with easy west-east access to the Pacific Coast Highway and downtown LA, and to the San Diego Freeway (405). It is also within 10-15 minutes’ walking distance of one of Los Angeles’s most notable pubs, with its huge stock of single-malt Scotches, and Old Speckled Hen as well as multiple cask and craft beers on tap. Parking is convenient, usually in front of the bungalow, otherwise not far from there. James himself was genial and promptly helpful whenever I had occasion to ask him about something. I’d return in a minute, if I were returning to LA, and I certainly expect to be in the not-too-distant future.",en
747328,83245167,2016-07-02,1349465,Mark,"This was a good say overall. Pros: -- Good location close to the beach. -- Nice, spacious place. -- Easy permit parking. -- Bedroom shades blocked out morning light pretty well. Neutral: -- The place was warm most of the day and evening.  I would just walk around in my boxers and it was fine.  Most older places in Santa Monica don't have a/c and it is quite a bit cooler than further inland. -- Noise: even with my white noise machine, I could hear a little traffic from the bedroom (which is in the back and removed from the street) as well as the person in the next bungalow walking/running before 7 a.m.  Not sure why this was cause bedroom wall doesn't directly connect to his unit but maybe the construction is just very sensitive.  Overall, quieter than most apartments and a little louder than most guest houses. -- Bed was fine.  A few spots that felt uncomfortable but I've slept on much worse. -- Backyard was nice to have but towards end of trip I noticed that these wires ran right above next to it and there seemed to be a buzzing sound so as a hypochondriac that stressed me out a bit.

Her place is clean, beautiful, and really comfortable. I was there to meet up with family but took some detours to explore LA. She had some guides but also gave me great tips on what to do and see. Her place is super close to the subway and it made getting around town so much easier. I didn't need to rent a car! So walkable to good eateries and bars in Silver Lake and Los Feliz. I will stay here again.",en

It came with gated parking and having a washer/drying in the apartment was a real bonus. Quynh welcomed me with tea and gave me a tour of the place. She asked if I had any specific needs and seemed genuinely happy to make my stay comfortable. Great location too. It's a very walkable neighborhood close to Sunset Junction in Silverlake. It was also super close to Hollywood and trails in Griffith Park.   Highly, highly recommend!  ",en

809072,42847713,2015-08-16,21019950,Kirsten,Quynh's apartment was an oasis away from my hectic LA study schedule. Quynh was always available to help with everything and is a super lovely lady! I stayed there by myself but there is plenty of room for two people to comfortably coexist- the lounge area is huge and couch is cosy. I loved opening the French windows and letting the breeze through. I had a perfect stay! ,en
809072,44010693,2015-08-23,5237822,Kathryn,"Quynh was a good host- easy to communicate with, flexible with check in and check out times, and responsive when I had a question or two throughout the weekend. The location worked well for us as we were adjacent to Silverlake and relatively close to downtown. She references this in the listing, but Quyhn was really concerned about her neighbors and noise- asking us not to play music and warning us that the neighbors downstairs can hear just about everything- so something to keep in mind when you're thinking through whether this space makes sense. This is Quyhn's home, and it feels very lived in- I felt more like I was crashing at a friend's, as opposed to on a weekend vacation getaway. Nothing wrong with that, of course- just depends on what you're looking for. ",en

821996,5139708,2013-06-15,1478106,Chris,"I've been renting a room for the last 6 months and I just renewed for another 6 months mostly because it's cheap and in a central location.  Cleanliness:My room has hardwood floors and it was dusty/dirty moving in but it's an old building so it's to be expected.  Bathrooms are again old, occasionally you'll see shit stains and toilet-paper stuck on the seats but they are cleaned I believe daily to sanitary standards.  Showers are usually clean but you'll probably see another person's hair... bring flip-flops or shower-sandals for hygienic reasons.  Kitchen is old as well and the ventilation sucks but you can microwave shit, there's a stove, and a toaster oven - fridge is tight with limited space.Occasional fruit fly will appear if you eat a banana in your room and leave the window open.  Safety:You are downtown and relatively close to skid-row yet in sort of the Arts District area so you should always be aware but it's somewhat safe.  The worst thing to happen to me was just recently in which my bicycle wheels, handlebar, and stem were stolen from my bicycle which was locked just outside the building (the frame was essentially left with my lock as I didn't lock my wheels).  I park my motorcycle on the street and so far nobody has fucked with it to my knowledge.Noise:There's the train the runs just across the street so that can be annoying as the windows are paper thin in terms of letting noise in.Weather:It can get pretty warm mid-day if you are facing the sun but at night it cools down to comfortable-sleeping levels.Price:Cheap, in term's of Yelp it would be a ""$"".  ($$$$$ = would be the priciest)  ",en

821996,40724551,2015-08-02,31026382,Nathan,"The room  was exactly what I expected. Furnished: bed w/ no sheets, desk, chair, mini-fridge, closet, and sink. There is a shared living space, shared kitchens, and a few shared bathrooms and showers on both floors. The laundry is shared and coin-operated, but I never had a conflict with trying to do laundry at the same time as anyone else. There are even shared dishes and pots/pans in the kitchen, but I suggest bringing some of your own. Overall, it was what I expected: a low maintenance room for me to sleep in and come home from work, while I was staying in LA for a summer. The greatest downside, SLOW INTERNET. I needed it specifically for work obligations, so this inconvenienced me personally. I would more likely leave and find a cafe somewhere instead.I moved here to intern during the summer downtown and knew that I would not have a car, so this location was perfect for me to walk to work and home very easily. The location is also very close to the metro, so I could easily get to places throughout the city that way as well. The neighborhood is sweet. The arts district is really sweet, and there are a lot of cool spots in Little Tokyo as well. That being said, just like any urban area, keep your wits at night and don't walk alone.",en

823617,3367584,2013-01-18,1833817,Marilyn,"This elegant little loft was just super!  The apartment is totally private while annexed to the larger house where Shaked lives.  There is a separate gated entrance and a lovely terrace that is made private from the neighbouring property by a dense and towering hedge.The loft is architecturally designed and so is efficiently laid out to give a full house feel in a small space.  Set into the steep hillside the two story windows offer views of the sunset and skyline that are gorgeous. The bed in the loft was ultra comfy and the cupboard space was abundant.  The fireplace was lovely to have on when nights got quite cool.  There is another separate heating/cooling unit that was welcome on the unseasonably cold nights.Just steps down the hill is the corner of Hollywood and Highland with all the entertainment and sparkle anyone could want while several blocks' walk away is the entrance to Runyon Canyon with serene trails and outdoor yoga.  The Hollywood Bowl is practically around the corner on N. Highland and access to 101 highway right there takes you to Universal Studios in minutes.Ralph's on Sunset, Gelson's on Franklin, Trader Joe's on Hollywood  are shopping options with other convenience stores in walking distance.  The parking is by permit - provided by Shaked - and  there was never a problem finding a space on the street.  The WiFi was adequate for computer use, but we sometimes found it a bit slow for (Hidden by Airbnb)  video.Shaked was an attentive and responsive host.  When the fuse in the heating unit needed replacing, Shaked responded immediately and was always a quick text away on any questions about services or recommendations in the area.

828216,614038262,2020-03-03,14904295,Ken,"I want to start by saying I'm overall satisfied. It was significantly less expensive than other options in the area, I wasn't sure what to expect, and I found it to be clean, minimalistic, and functional. If I'm in the area again and needing an inexpensive place I will stay there again.That said, this review will focus on a few specific surprises / gotchas / things I would have liked to know beforehand, so that you can make an informed decision based on whether these things are important to you, or consider them a small price to pay in order to, uh, have a small price to pay.The place is very minimalistic. There were two towels, two hand towels, but no floor mat. In fact there are no floor coverings of any kind — no rug, carpet, or welcome mat. The floor is cement and is cool but not cold. The heating and cooling work fine. I was provided with a bar of Dove, new and unopened, and a travel-size combo shampoo/conditioner. The internet worked fine sometimes and at other times was agonizingly, in fact unusably slow. (Techies, I tried the 2.4, the 5, and direct ethernet, so it wasn't the wifi.) In order to get work done during high-traffic times I tethered to my cell phone.There's functional silverware, dishware, cookware, and literally nothing else. I had a small spill on the floor in and to clean it up I used toilette paper. You get the idea. Minimalist. Pillows, blankets, even the decorations, are all present but bargain quality.The biggest inconvenience was check in and check out. You'll need to first find street parking — and note the street is No Stopping 7-10am and 4-7pm — then use a gate code to get into the building, a door code to get into the apartment, to retrieve the parking garage opener. Then go back out to your car and you can park in the garage and unload. For me this process took about 20 minutes.Check-out is similar. You'll need the clicker to get your car out onto the street, but then you'll need to return it to the apartment before you depart. Again, note the no-stopping times above.Like I said, these are the surprises / gotchas / things I wish I'd known. And, like I said, given all that, yes, I would stay there again if the price difference still holds.",en

There are cuss words written on the chalk wall and phrases like ""suicide is comforting"" scrolling across the digital sign in the master bedroom.  To be fair, Gabriel spent an hour trying to shut the sign down before my husband simply unplugged it.  To stay here,  you should be a morning person because there are NO window treatments even in the bedrooms.  There were 2 very used sleep masks however on the bedside table.

She was quick to respond to all my questions.  She bought a futon for a an extra person, rather than an air matress or having my daughter sleep on the couch.  Her home was much larger than the pictures let on and easily accomodated my family of 5, plus a baby.  We all slept well with the music of her fountains lulling us to dreamland on warm nights.  We did a fair amount of cooking and the kithchen is well stocked with cookware and appliances.  We were provided with coffee, milk, other staples and the sweetest grapefruit ever.  Hannah allowed us to entertain other family members that had come to LA.  We were able to eat in her back yard as the weather was also perfect.  And did I mention the lemons growing in the yard and the wonderful birds and trees?  This experience helped make our trip warm and relaxing, which is not something I generally feel when I come to LA.

888863,5625462,2013-07-08,4266550,Will,"Paul is a great host and it was very enjoyable staying at his place.  The place is an elegant free-standing house in the hills on a lot covered in fruit trees.  The Echo Park neighborhood reminded me of the artsy, crunchy parts of the East SF Bay Area where I live.  I stayed there with my wife, my two-year-old kid, and both my parents.  We all felt very at home.  I would gladly stay there again if given a reason to be in LA.As a host, Paul was responsive, generous, and considerate.  After receiving unexpected news about the health of my grandmother who lives in LA, I messaged Paul on a Saturday night to try to book his place for Monday.  Paul replied in a few hours and offered his place.He was forthright about potential mismatches between what his place offerred and what I, traveling with a pregnant spouse and a two-year-old kid, might need.  He warned us about the heat wave in LA and the place being less tidy because a previous guest had just vacated.  These turned out not to be problematic. On Sunday, while I vacillated about when I should drive down, Paul received a better offer to rent his place, but he declined it since he had already offered his place to me.  (I know about this because his agent actually agreed to that offer without consulting him, and it showed up on the AirBnB calendar.)Having a host like Paul was what made us feel at home, on a trip that was one of the most significant in my life.",en

It turned out to be a great fit, not just for our needs as tenants but also as a sanctuary from long days on the set. The spacious house is relaxing and set in a quiet but hip hillside neighborhood. There are pomegranate trees and beautiful landscaping. It was very relaxing to be able to water the various fruit trees and greenery. Paul was easy to deal with and we enjoyed using his barbeque in the backyard. There’s a front yard, a back yard, and a big driveway equipped with a working restaurant stove. Street parking wasn’t a problem either. We highly recommend for a family on vacation or an artist looking for a quiet place to get work done.

If you do have a car, it's a bit of a hassle to find parking and usually have to park a couple blocks away. Little Tokyo is a very cute area, but beware of skid row where lots of homeless people habitats. Cleanliness- The manager cleans the bathrooms pretty much every day. The kitchen can get a little messy since you are sharing with everyone in the building, but for the most part people clean after themselves. Be sure to bring cups, plates and utensils since these supplies are limited. The stove was broken for a week and the sinks leak. The owner of the place referred me to contact the manager who left me a key in the lock box. I had trouble opening it, but was fortunate that someone who lived in the building could help. The manager seems very friendly, but is reluctant to help for small favours since he says it's not really part of his job description.",en
899872,35593067,2015-06-20,34696936,Soovin,"This location is great - it's located 5 minutes outside of the metropolitan area of Los Angeles. It's in the Arts District, which has seen some dramatic changes to its old buildings, and there's a lot of chic shops and coffee bars in the area. Also, little Tokyo is only a few blocks away, and there's a lot of options for eating. I would recommend this place for people who need a temporary place while settling into Los Angeles. The room is clean, but it is hot - there's no AC. You can open the window, but be prepared for loud noises. It's next to the metro rail, and traffic is non-stop until around 11-12am. Unfurnished is exactly that: unfurnished. Unless you have an air mattress or a futon, be prepared for a hard wooden floor that's seen better days. I thought I could get by with a blanket and a sleeping bag - don't do it. But the bathrooms are cleaned daily, the roommates are cool people, and all in all, you're really paying for the location. If you need maintenance assistance, ask Alex, the building manager. He can help you out with lost keys, broken equipment, etc.",en

He sent us a personal email providing instructions on how to get in the building however as we were travelling and did not have access to WiFi so needless to say we did not get this info. We contact Sean by phone when we were on our way and was told necessary info was on email but we can call him once we get to his building and he will run through everything with us.  We arrived and called but his phone was off.  We eventually got inside the building and use the leasing agent's WiFi to access our email in order to find the keys he had left us. On entering the apartment we found it was not the luxury penthouse we were expecting.  It was not a spare room in Sean's apartment but his bedroom that he rents out when he is away.  There were also 2 flat mates with one living in the upstairs converted lounge room, there was an old dog with hair all over the floor and dog's droppings all over the roof terrace which was one of the main selling points of the apartment. We spent 45 mins cleaning the filthy kitchen and fridge so we can put our food inside.  We went out and upon our return the clean kitchen was once again littered with dirty dishes.

The beds are comfortable, the linens soft and cozy, and the furniture is stylish yet practical so that we never worried our 3-year old might break something or get hurt.  They even had stuffed animals, coloring pencils and a doll waiting for her in her room!Only steps from the beach and Washington pier, their rental unit is ideal for a family (or two!) with kids.

You can use the beach walk all the way from Washington Blvd to and past Santa Monica pier. It's 5,2 km to Santa Monica. Don't miss the skate park at Venice.

There are some really loud noises that will reverberate in the house from the roof if there is a storm. Little things like batteries not working on the remotes, sheets left in the washer, stuffed animals inside the closets, and no dishwashing soap initially provided made it not the most pleasant place to stay. Steven was great though and came through on the latter. It’s rather cheap compared to other houses in the area for it’s size but the drawbacks are listed above.",en

House is on a quiet residential street but turn the corner and you see the ocean. We were at the beach (and beachside playgrounds) multiple times every day and our 3yo was happy to make the walk. Even closer is Main Street which has lots of cafe and restaurant options. Slightly further, but still within easy waking distance, are ultra-trendy or commercial areas like Rose, Abbot Kinney and 3rd St promenade. It’s rare to be able to walk anywhere in LA so having so much on our doorstep was a true luxury. House: charming, spacious and comfortable 100 yo craftsman. Plenty of space for our family and had everything we needed. One warning: this is an actual family home, not a sterile pseudo-hotel. For the most part that was a good thing (properly stocked kitchen, various handy bits and bobs available if needed).

That said, some days I didn't even leave the house because it was such an inviting retreat space.Sheena was wonderful to talk to, and we shared lovely conversations over delicious breakfast that she cooked for me.

House is huge - we had 6 people in 5 rooms comfortably and if we had couples instead of bunch on loners, we could've easily fit more. It is not only big, but also cosy and quite stylish. The interiors are the pleasure to the eye, and  a lot of stylish details add to all-in-all artistic atmosphere.Neighborhood is great and peaceful. Lots of restaraunts and cafes around from ethnic to healthy to classic American. Mark was a spectacular host, really nice and helpful, made us feel very comfortable in a city.We've used both BBQ's and invited some friends - that was a lot of fun and much easier than we expected.Overall, this is a perfect house, very nice owners and I couldn't recommend it more!",en

From the first inquiry to the time we left the house, Mark was friendly, responsive and extremely helpful!   We stayed there for a total of four weeks and he made sure that we were completely comfortable.   From the moment we walked in, we felt like we were living in luxury.   From the cook’s delight kitchen (we constantly were cooking), to the entertainment room,  the rain shower and BBQ grills we were in heaven.  All the rooms were spacious and the cleaning service once a week was such a treat.   It provided the ideal setting for our group to rest, relax, and cultivate a home away from home.    It was also great that it was set in a really walkable neighborhood.   Our group was able to walk to multiple restaurants, coffee shops and bars as well as take the METRO downtown to where we were interning.     If there was anything that we needed or had questions about we could easily reach someone and they were attended to with prompt enthusiasm.   I would highly recommend the house to any other groups of travelers who are looking to enjoy Los Angeles at its finest.",en

951515,6956927,2013-09-01,6570744,Corey,"We rented this place for a full month.  There were many good things and a few significant not so good things with this stay.  On the good side, Dr. Rev. Louise Diana was a responsive, warm and open host.  A really nice person who went out of her way to accommodate us.  The location is great, there is a nice little outdoor sitting area, parking in the building, 2 full bathrooms and a nice bedroom that is as pictured.  There are great healthy restaurants, juice bars and shops within walking distance and the beach is only 5 blocks away.On the negative side, the place is pretty dated overall - with older kitchenware, cabinets, bathroom fixtures, etc.  There is also not real kitchen or dining room table and chairs.  Those issues are all  outweighed by the positives.  There were two big issues that were not outweighed by the positives.  The living room furniture is cheap , old, torn and very uncomfortable.  The pictures make it look much, much better than it is.  The other huge issue was that the refrigerator was pretty gross and smelly with old food and mold and still smelled even after cleaning three times.While we were staying there, someone came in to measure for a new refrigerator though so, hopefully, the host has replaced the old one and solved that issue.  If the the host also replaced the living room furniture, we would definitely consider staying there again.  But without resolution of these two items we will be looking elsewhere. ",en

The house was very spacious and immediately gave off that homie feeling that we much needed with us being thousands of miles away from home. She has a gorgeous garden on the back patio that I woke to each morning to start my vacation off just right. The location couldn't of been better, with the ocean just a simple bike ride away and 5th street right around the corner. The house was very clean and we really had no problems at all.  We will certainly keep the house in mind when we visit again next year :)",en

She has a warm and kind spirit of herself :)There were 3 of us at her home which is conveniently 5 blocks from the beautiful beaches ( a very short walk which we did daily ) and shops, restaurants, coffee.On another positive note was the parking she had... We would come back late at night and we always had a parking space available for us.  It was also nice to have the 2 full bathrooms . The actual town home area is quiet and peaceful... Very comfortable surroundings.My only negative would be the living room couch. My daughter and I slept upstairs and my husband slept on the small pullout couch. The couch was very old and torn. He would sleep on the floor  because the couch was not comfortable at all.  We however were fortunate to have stayed here... I felt at anyone moment I could contact her with any questions and she would quickly respond ... Gave us a true feeling of living in Santa Monica .",en

951515,75994900,2016-05-24,55969829,Christopher,"On a positive front, the Yoga Priestess was very responsive and quick to get back on any questions.  However, she was on a tight schedule when we were there which made accessing the townhouse challenging.  The surrounding neighborhood is quiet and well located with an easy walk/ride to the beach, shops and great restaurants.  Parking is convenient and secure which is a plus. However, the townhouse is extremely tired and badly in need of updating.  The couch and chairs shown are all badly ripped with the upholstery showing through the arms.   The carpeting is discolored and stained in spots . It needs to be replaced throughout.  There is no table if one wants to eat a meal; you have to eat off of your lap.  The kitchen is small and there are limited appliances ie no toaster. If you plan to eat a meal in the town house, it is not easy.  The single bed is comfortable, but again the bedding and pillows could be updated.  The pillows are paper thin and two additional ones would be a big bonus. The fold out couch is much less comfortable and not a great option for sleeping.  You would be better off with an air mattress. The bathrooms were ""clean"" but also tired and stained from years of use.  The toilet seat broke during our stay so three of us ended up with one bathroom.  One toilet leaked and kept recycling every 45 minutes or so.   Not great for sleeping.  There was a smell (mildew?) that pervaded the townhouse that was partially alleviated with the windows left open.  It was particularly noticeable when we returned from a day out with the windows closed.   The closets and draws were jammed full so one had to plan on living out of a suitcase.  In short the townhouse needs a serious upgrade in order to be worthy of the price charged.  I cannot recommend this property as a place to stay despite its great location.  ",en

The neighborhood is very quiet, although there could be renovations going on in adjacent apartments, but nothing serious. For coffee lovers, note there is no coffee maker, but there are some excellent cafes 4-5 blocks away. The washing machine is in a common area and uses quarters, which can be hard to get in this cashless economy, so make sure to bring some in case you are planning on long stays.

The place was perfect for us as it is centrally located in Downtown LA in walking distance of all important venues, and a Starbucks and a taco truck across the street. Adam has just refurbished the loft and everything is new (furniture, TV, wireless, equipment)- we literally used everything for the first time. Adam is a great host, he was very helpful in giving directions and shared his local LA knowledge of nice places to visit, eat etc. I would stay with Adam again anytime.",en
962768,4573493,2013-05-13,5481320,Kevin,"I should have been one of the first to review Adam's loft, but unfortunately I did not get a chance until now.I want to first say that Adam was what I wanted in a host he was hospitable, easy to contact and either took care of or provided options for any requirements I had.  That in and of itself I appreciated.As for the loft, I would more than likely stay there again before considering another location as it has good access to most major freeways.  If you attending an event at the (whoever paid the most) Convention Center and Live Theater it's just a short walk a few blocks away.  There was good food all around, and I drove a few minutes in various directions to get Mexican, Philippines, Vietnamese, and Japanese foods.Speaking of food, I also spent more than 50% of my meals not eating out but rather taking advantage of the well equipped and spacious kitchen.  I found most of the kitchen equipment I needed to prepare the meals (and several snacks) in the cupboards overhead.  I also prepared an assortment of hors d'oeuvres… Why you might ask.  I'll tell you…The loft space is quite nice.  So nice intact that there as enough room for several meetings and a couple of cocktail parties during my time there.  The open floor plan lends itself to entertaining and the bar sitting in the arm of the kitchen was absolutely perfect and felt like being at home—after a fashion.And as for fashion, the apartment had quite a bit of personality while maintaing a clean and spacious environment.  A rather late flatscreen sits flush against a wall and I was easily able to connect my computer (or iOS device) to the A/V system and play my music and watch a few movies… okay, it was YouTube. Don't you judge me.  (^_^)The bed was comfortable and although I had more than enough room for guests to stay with separate futon-couch, large couch (if necessary).  Also, that may be the one, and the only thing, to consider when thinking about staying in a loft as normally there are no walls between the spaces, although there were strategically placed room separators which is decorative and functional.Speaking of functional…  in one of the two large bathrooms there is a door that leads to a utility room with a washer and dryer which I made full use of.  I also made use of the closet system that had more than enough room.  Lastly, I should say that there is two parking spots, and as I drove down, and had gusts there it was great.In closing I would, and have, recommended Adam's loft.  The loft is comfortably modern in a good location and a great owner.  I'l looking forward to my next visit to Los Angeles as I know exactly where I'll be staying.Thank you again Adam for the cozy loft space. Cheers!",en

The loft was more than adequate, wonderfully furnished, easily accessible, and superbly convenient.

962768,5097213,2013-06-12,1468981,Gavin,"This place is awesome if you have business in downtown LA. The unit itself is bright and spacious, with a wide wall of windows and well-appointed furnishings.  It's conveniently located just a few blocks from the convention center, so this was a major score for us for E3 week.The unit is hardwood throughout, with lovely leather furniture and two separate beds and bathrooms.  Note that this is a completely open space except for the bathrooms.  If you are staying with another couple or group, you will only have the most basic privacy.  For myself and my girlfriend, it felt like a palace.We had no issues at all with the building during our stay. The building interior itself is fairly basic and could use some cleaning, but it in no way reflected on Adam's unit.  We had no problem at all with any noise from neighbors or neighboring buildings.  Being right next to a Starbucks was a nice bonus to get us moving in the morning.  There were at least three ZipCar locations within less than a mile radius as well.Adam was kind and gracious upon arriving, and dealt well when our flight got delayed by three hours.  He arrived promptly and was very friendly and informative.  Adam spent time setting up the AV system and making sure we had everything we needed.  When we noticed that there was no hairdryer, Adam told us to buy one and he'd leave cash for us later.  He did, and now the unit has a hair dryer.  One small issue arose at 'checkout' that bears mentioning - Adam had told me in passing to leave the key with the exterior parking guard, but didn't elaborate on why. Our airport cab showed up a full 15 minutes early, and in the haste to leave, I figured leaving the keys on the counter would be fine.  Adam was (far) out of town when he later called me, and had a minor freakout because apparently there were no backup keys.  He regained his composure quickly and said he'd work it out, but I felt truly awful about the situation.  I'm sure in the future he'll have a backup plan, but be sure and get clarity on checkout procedure.  Also be careful in general - the door locks behind you automatically when you leave!",en

Wifi is fast. Both bathrooms are large and work well.We also went to Venice Beach and Santa Monica a few times.

And I always felt safe in the neighborhood, even on those rare occasions when I needed to walk alone at night by myself.  I stayed in the loft for 10 weeks while I was working in LA for the summer, and it was perfect for me. Just a 10 minute drive from downtown (also walking distance, but I chose to drive), it was so nice being so centrally located.  The loft comes with two free parking spaces which was amazing. Santa Monica and the beach is a quick drive away when I wanted to get out of downtown.

The privacy you are given at this stay is unbeatable. I honestly don’t think I saw my host even one time— however They were quick to respond if I needed anything at all. The interior is so artistic.

Justin was a terrific host. He kept in touch initially to make sure our entry was simple, he made sure we had everything we needed and communication was a phone all away.

Super responsive, kind and generous. There was an internet shortage in the area on our last day & we sent him a quick message. Within 5 minutes he was on the phone with us allowed us into the main house to try to fix it because he was unable to be there himself. He stayed on the phone with us for 20+ minutes and even though the problem was not his fault was super apologetic. On top of that he was super flexible with check in & out times.

990385,6779398,2013-08-25,6624490,Joann,"Had a pretty great summer here! Since I am a college student, the shared bathrooms and showers didn't bother me at all (which are cleaned everyday), the place had a dorm feel. Bring extra toilet paper because sometimes the bathrooms run out and that sucks! The kitchen is communal and everyone shares pans and stuff, but I brought a lot of my own things. The fridge is crowded so try to bring your own mini fridge. Alex is super cool and helpful, and he emails you back quickly if you need to contact him. Never saw Jay, he doesn't live there. Place is literally on the border, if not in, Little Tokyo! Such a good location. Btw there are like 5 places to get groceries in the area-ish: the Little Tokyo Plaza Market on Alameda/3rd, Nijiya Market in the Japanese Village Plaza, Marukai Market in Weller Court on Onizuka St, the City Target off the 7th center metro stop, and Food for Less off the gold line metro. You can meet a lot of cool people here; since I was here during the summer on an internship, I was really lucky got to meet people from all over the U.S. and the world who were temporarily staying for internships or on vacation too. The people who are living there long-term mostly keep to themselves and you don't really see them around. The wifi is a little problematic, it really only works downstairs in the kitchen, or on the stairs leading up to the roof. Also I don't really recommend hanging out in the living room area with all the couches.....",en
990385,23379302,2014-11-30,18258531,Angela,"I was surrounded by eclectic neighbors and a sweet landlord. In a city that can stress one out, it was secure and welcoming place.",en
990385,24872439,2015-01-03,11472749,Kendra,"Overall the experience was fine... Nothing good nor bad to report. I was (hopefully) a fairly simple renter. I arrived and left out of normal hours and they were able to accommodate that with a secured lock box and clear information on how to get into the location. My only negative I'd say is perhaps a little more information inside would be helpful. I kind of had to wander around to find the room, shower and toilet. Which in the light of day was simple enough but since I arrived tired after traveling 19 hours from Amsterdam was a bit trickier.Also, and I've seen this in other reviews, but the refrigerator leaves a bit to be desired. It was pretty disgusting, to be polite, and I did not feel as if I wanted to leave anything inside. It's a tricky situation since I suspect lots of people come and go (with various levels of cleanliness) but I think they could be better at maintaining that. Be aware that the walls are quiet thin so you should bring ear plugs if you don't want to hear the guy in the next door room snooze alarm going off at 7am. Which was also noted by another guest telling me I should be more careful when shutting the door within 5 minuets of my arrival. The doors/building is old and a bit funky to deal with but once you're use to it should be no issue.",en
990385,30789954,2015-04-27,17924092,Stephen,"We were able to pick up our keys at check-in in a lock-box at the front door. I think the room description was very accurate. This building is very much like a hostel, in the best sense of the word. We saw and met a variety of renters during our week stay. All were friendly. Some have been living there for 10+ months as long-term tenants. I spent a fair bit of time on my laptop in the large communal kitchen. They have 2 round tables that maybe sit 4 each. I was not disturbed and found it to be a really nice spot to work. Our son goes to SCI-Arc and it was a VERY easy walk. There are a number of eateries within a very close radius including a Starbucks. I highly recommend the Pie Hole for meat pies, pastries and coffee. The communal showers and bathrooms weren't as bad as it might sound. All were clean. The front lobby area is a comfortable place to relax with your laptop or some reading material. We will stay here in the future when we visit our son.",en

990385,45370051,2015-09-02,33874760,Cynthia,"Here's my review after living here for 10 weeks: Great location, so many wonderful places to eat and shop in walking distance. There are 3 groceries stores nearby. The building is on a residential street, it feels safe walking at anytime. The people I met were all nice, but it is pretty easy to hear your neighbors closing doors and walking around or playing music. The building is very old, the floors and the walls are pretty dirty looking. I saw a roach once, but no other pest problems. Once the light broke in the bathroom and took about a week before it was fixed. The bed room was in good condition, pretty clean on arrival. It has a sink in it which is convenient. The ceiling is pretty high so that helps keep it cool even through the summer, there were only a few days where it was too hot without AC. The important areas like the shower are also very clean although old. I thought the water was kinda weird,  it left residue in my hair and I could smell gas. The shower and toilet is shared but never had to wait. My main dislike was the toilet room, which did not have a sink in it, so I felt that was pretty unsanitary. Also the internet was terrible for the first month, it got better after that, but still randomly disconnects almost every hour. Some downsides, but overall I would still recommend because of the amazing neighborhood and it's livable for a low price. ",en

990385,287872080,2018-07-08,196093019,Robert,"First and foremost, this is a college style dorm. I was on the second floor and that floor had 3 bathrooms and 1 shower for the whole floor (around 30ish rooms I think). The sinks are in the individual rooms which was nice yet a little odd at times.The room came with a single bed, desk, small fridge, fan, and a power strip were generously provided. The room was built with a small closet and a sink. The room had an air conditioning unit, but it did not work. I am unsure if the unit was broken or I could not figure it out. All the light switches on the floor were up for off and down for on. My room’s light sometimes would not turn on, but if I flipped the light switch enough times it would come on. I would recommend this place to people looking to only use the room to sleep at night, especially if the air conditioning unit does not work. It is very nice for a place to crash. It is a value space a block away from Little Tokyo and 3 blocks away from the Doubletree hotel where Anime Expo had a route the last two times I went to the convention. Overall 4 out of 5 stars. Great space for an amazing price with the only major problem being the air conditioning.",en

Mona is always open for some conversations, she laughs a lot and you always also need to laugh because her smile makes you so happy!The apartment is very clean and tidily. It always smells good, either because Mona has cooked some of her delicious meals or because of the smell of a good smelling candle! The room is as shown in the picture. You have a cozy bed, a big wardrobe with hangers, a desk, a chair, a minifridge and another shelf. Its definitely enough space. If you want to cook, there are enough pots and pans, if you want to chill or watch TV you can also use the living room. Washers and Dryers are also available in the area, and with 0.75 Dollars each its very cheap compared to wash saloons. The apartment has also a good location.

Two big supermarkets where you can get everything are also very close, around 5 minutes walk.

Her house is in a private complex, so it feels very safe. It is approx 30mins by bus (Rapid 6 on Sepulveda Blvd or Rapid12 on Westwood Blvd) to UCLA, but it is convenient also if you have to go to Santa Monica (metro or bus number 8). Download the Transit app and you can check real time info ;) There are supermarkets close to Mona's and the covenience of the bus stops makes it easy to do pretty much anything. As for Mona, she is just great. I spent Thanksgiving with her family and is something that I will never forget. Also she is a very good cook.

However a couple of things to note, the Kitchen is not really fully stocked for cooking, it has a coffee machine, but no measuring jugs e.t.c so don't expect to cook anything complex. Also we happened to be at the place during a very hot period and the A.C just wasn't up to it, it was so hot most nights that e had pretty bad sleep (we are however British so take that into account). Location wise, the apartment is in a slightly dodgy area (every time we got a cab/Uber the drivers where surprised we would be staying in this area).It's also not really walkable to most of the old town pasadena amenities or any decent shops/restaurants so if you are in need of these you will need to get a bus or drive. That said, the parking in pasadena is free for 90 minutes and plentiful so not a huge issue.",en

Clean enough room and bath room amenities. Bed was comfortable to get a good night rest.Distance to old pasadena little far for walking distance, but since we are driving it was no issue. The clean filter sign was on for the aircon, we contacted and informed Kathleen about it. We end up keep using the aircon as is for our stay (aircon still working with no problem). Just inconvience thought about the clean filter indication.During our 7 days stay we did clean up and vacuum ourself twice. We found out on first try that vacuum did not hev a strong suction. We figured out that it was not properly cleaned and correctly assembled from last used. After cleaning up the filter container, and properly assembled vacuum got it suction power back.Overall experience was good. Welcome goodies basket was a nice touch.",en

They responded promptly and I appreciate that. My family and I enjoyed the cuteness of the space along with having the fully stocked kitchen, outdoor grill, soft linens and towels, soft futon bed, and front grassy/gated play area for the kids.

Helena and her team were first class all the way, tending to the very few requests or issues I may have had. It is cozy and had everything I needed for the transition into a new home state. It is very convenient to downtown Pasadena and the 210 going either north or east. If I had to list anything that was negative, it would be occasionally, the neighbors directly behind the unit can be loud. It wasn’t anything other than a nuisance at times, but something that happened about once a week and I just learned to deal with it. Parking for a single car is perfect, right on property and off the street. If you do bring a second car, be sure to have the proper parking permits as you will get ticketed - I know firsthand.

Moreover, since this is a functioning ranch, you can have fresh milk from one of two cows (the fatter cow provides whole milk and the skinnier cow, 1% - funny!) and fresh eggs from the chickens.  The staff that takes care of the overall facilities is always on call to help with cleaning or any questions that you may have.

The place itself is nicely furnished and gets a beautiful cross breeze most days. Fans help in the summer. Plus, as I arrived in a heat wave, Lynda arranged to have a portable AC unit delivered by her handyman. That was a big help for that very warm week. Very much appreciated Lynda!! Parking was the only headache. And it was not much of a headache at all considering the rest of the pluses. Just heed the street cleaning days and times in the neighborhood - or be ready to pay $63 when you don't. Put an alarm in your phone. That's what I did. The neighborhood is IMHO the best neighborhood in Santa Monica. But that is a personal preference. Bottom line - unless there is something seriously wrong with you, you will enjoy the convenience, the less dense traffic, the availability of parking on neighborhood streets, the lack of homeless folks peeing in alleys and panhandling, a more professional older family oriented crowd, and of course the proximity to the big blue waters and the less crowded beaches found north of Montana. I enjoyed my stay and was sad to leave. ",en

I was able to do all my basic shopping and errands on foot: a 20-minute walk gets you to several supermarkets, pharmacies, cafés, and a variety of places to eat and drink, including some of L.A.'s best restaurants. It's only a slightly farther walk to the beach.

Her place is lovely and it was so nice to be in a cottage in beautiful manhattan beach, right by the water and walking distance to downtown manhattan beach and the local cafes and restaurants to the north.  The beach was just steps away - very easy to just walk out to the water.  The location/neighborhood is fantastic - very beautiful, safe and easy to walk.  We live in Southern California so this was a staycation for us.  I highly recommend it for faraway travelers and locals.   If you want activities for your kids, the beach is super close and there are nearby surf camps for both adults and kids.  We did not need to use our car most of the time.  We just walked or took public transportation (neighborhood trolley or ride-sharing).   If you want to shop you can go to the stores in downtown or drive out a mile away inland to the new outdoor shopping areas.  The place itself was lovely.  The bed was really comfortable and it was nice to have a fully stocked kitchen including refrigerator and oven.  ",en

1058616,365864533,2019-01-01,18117245,Susanne,"We stayed in the downstairs apartment over New Years. Very cute decor and we were amazed by all the little details. When you like a  traditional style, this is for you. The only new item inside the apartment I noticed is the TV. The TV is a smart TV, very cool. WiFi works great as well. We traveled with our 18 months old son, so we had to baby proof the place a bit, but it was doable. A little cramped with the baby bed inside the bedroom, but we managed. The traditional light fixtures did not allow for much light. Being downstairs, the rooms in the back are a very dark (bedroom and bathroom). The entire place cools down very quickly. I am sure this is very desirable  in the summer time. We on the other hand  to use the heater at this time of year. There was only one floor heater for the apartment, so the bedroom was always very cold while all else was super hot as we had to keep the bedroom door shut with the baby sleeping. Baby also burned his feet on the floor heater, so that caused quite a scare, but luckily it was just a superficial burn and he was back to normal the very next day. Putting that aside, we had a wonderful stay. Annette is super responsive and sweet. Kitchen is equipt with some dishes and glasses, but it's small and we did not attempt to cook a meal, even though it was very tempting to use this amazing stove for more than just cooking water. The location was perfect for us, Easy walk to downtown (we love walking), or to El Porto in the north. El Porto has many great breakfast places: Two Guns coffee is the best! Amazing pastries at Wild Cafe. We ordered Pitfire Pizza at night. They do deliver and it's always amazing. There are sooo many great restaurants in downtown Manhattan Beach: MB Post, Little Sister, Love and Salt....Super quick walk down to the beach, two short blocks down the hill. Annette offered us beach chairs and towels to use. We were also able to use the washer and dryer inside her garage. There is a parking spot available outside as well, which was a must for us with all our baby gear. I would definitely recommend staying at Annette's place. Pictures are accurate. You get what you see.",en

And the bonus, Dewy's hospitality is second to none!  There is plenty of privacy, it's quiet and in a beautiful newer neighborhood community, but close enough to all major freeways.  I would definately stay here again, in fact, I'm afraid it's so good I will never again be able to book it once the word gets out. But, be warned, this is a strictly professionals only booking, not for everyone, she's very picky on screening guests as she should be-don't book here is you don't like removing your shoes and living in white carpet and furniture, too sophisticated for kids.",en

We stayed with Dewi for 10 nights following the birth of our grand daughter. One grandma stayed for a few nights, and then we switched. We were greeted with fresh fruit, chocolates, and bottled water. Each morning, Dewi cooked us a hot breakfast with coffee, juice, and fresh fruit. Several mornings she made breakfast and fruit salad for us to take to our family, and even made a wonderful tossed salad for the family on two occasions.

1076860,37216810,2015-07-05,92019,Grace,"Everything about Thah's Casita Reservoir is consistent with the images, description and positive reviews. Actually, the information you see here on Airbnb exceeds what we have experienced at this sweet little oasis, tucked away in a splendid part of the Silver Lake neighborhood. The Casita is behind a lovely larger house and the access is through an almost hidden alley. Tucked away! Cozy! And, safe -  this 60 year old active grandma always feels protected on Tnah's property. This is our second visit to the Casita and, excuse me for the cliche, but we felt right at home as we did the first time. We pulled into the driveway through a locked gate from the alley. Parked in a paved, spacious driveway then walked through Tnah's garden which is always being developed and improved. The little Casita is graced with a front yard, covered porch and lots of shade gifted from a wide and leafy mature tree. Enter and find yourself in a beautifully decorated living room. It was a warm week during our stay and in anticipation of our arrival, Tnah opened all the latches on the original screened windows along with a big electric fan blasting into the living room. Instant chill! The hallway from the main living area leads to the one bedroom on the left furnished with antiques and a bed with a perfect mattress. There were more opened screened windows as well as a ceiling fan already at work. Across the hall is a well equipped kitchen, with a sweet decor, a perfect butcher block island, and a breakfast nook.  Atop the island, Tnah provides substantial treats - her own roast coffee from her husband's business, a crusty baguette, wedge of brie, olives, chocolate, a pot of jam, and a bowl filled with donut peaches and bananas. Thus, you don't have to leave the house for dinner on the evening of your arrival. The bathroom is narrow but not confining. Bath and shower combo, fluffy and sweet smelling towels, lots of amenities and toiletries. Bonus - washer and dryer adjacent to the kitchen! We travelled home with clean clothes, something that is strangely satisfying.Our week at the Casita flew by quickly as we settled in nicely in the cottage. You will want to live here, or at least camp out for a month to work on your plans for world domination through peace, finish a writing or geeky project, spend quality time with the one you love. Finally, this needs to be said - $165 is a steal compared to nearby hotel rates. There is a Comfort Inn across the street that's cheaper, but not at all worth it given poor Yelp reviews. Pick the charming Casita, if you can get on the calendar. ",en

The cottage is older, very rustic in a 1930's hollywood sort of way, one could imagine what silver lake was back then. When there were any issues Tnah and Mario were very quick to address.The cottage is private with fenced in sunny back and shaded front yards and private parking. It's well lit at night with warm welcoming lighting on the front patio and covered outdoor table. Our kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed and we were greeted with a generous welcome basket from Tnah and Mario filled with an assortment of delicious antipasto goodies, fruit bowl and sweet treats, plus Mario's own fine coffee beans (and more when we ran out).The casita is thoughtfully designed and tastefully decorated while leaving enough space to make it your own during your stay. Warm touches can be found throughout the living spaces from extra throw blankets, creams and soaps to sage, candles and fresh linens which made our stay extra cozy.We enjoyed the close location to Sunset with lots of shops and restaurants and grocery store that we could walk to at any given time.

(Although the dining table pictured is no longer there--it didn't matter to us, but keep that in mind.) There were so many thoughtful touches, from the welcome basket to the box of new toothpaste in the bathroom. It felt like we were staying at the home of friends while they were away.

We walked everywhere even though we did have a car.  The off -street, gated parking area was a blessing.  Communication with Tnah was so easy and prompt.  Mario came by as we were leaving and was a lot of fun to talk to. The small back yard is a little oasis in the big city!  I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone who wants to explore Silver Lake and Echo Park.",en

1076860,492862292,2019-07-21,7055881,Erica,"We had a very pleasant stay for over a month at Tnah and Mario’s place. The home is very well located close by to some really cool spots-plenty of restaurants and parks, but far enough away that it is really quiet and safe. We stayed with our dog and baby and felt totally comfortable during our time. The yard is completely fenced in and separate from the other unit. Tnah even brought over a high chair and shared some babysitter contacts with us. The place has a lot of nice touches and feels very homey. I’m glad we chose to stay here and would recommend it to any couple or small family looking to spend some time in LA. My only caveat is that in the contract we signed, it stated that there would be a complementary cleaning for folks staying more than 8 days. When I inquired about scheduling this with Tnah she said that they no longer offer that because “it didn’t work out.”  Instead, she shared her housekeeper’s number who charges $100. A complementary cleaning after 2 weeks would have been a nice gesture considering we stayed so long and spent over $4,000.",en

Very clean, with a huge wraparound balcony that is totally secluded, rooftop balcony that over looks the entire city!!  You feel like your a celebrity staying in a private villa at a 5 Star hotel / resort or something.. Li was 1st class, anything I needed she was just a phone call away.. Ladies & Gentlemen I could write all day about this place but words couldn't truly describe how you'll feel staying there.. I'm in la quite often and I know this place & what she's had done and location makes it easily close to a million dollar unit..

It truly is magical, quite possibly because it's so close to the Magic Castle! The unit feels like your own home because its the penthouse.  You have your own entrance and 2 private patios.  The house is bright and cheerful during the day and romantic and enchanting at night.  My family and I sat outside on the private patio outside the living room and gazed at the stars, the moonlight and the lights of Hollywood. The street is beautiful, charming and quiet.  It feels like you are in a European town, but you are steps away from all the attractions of Hollywood.  You can walk to Hollywood & Highland, the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Runyon Canyon and many other ""LA"" things.  Angelina was a charming and wonderful host.  She gave us many suggestions on where to go and what to do.  We especially loved being able to walk to the Roosevelt Hotel and the restaurant and lounge there.

The neighborhood is nestled back from the crowded streets and very quiet.  Parking was available and easy in front of the unit. Walking distance to Hollywood Walk of Fame, Dolby Theater, Hollywood Bowl, etc.  You do have to plan/time your exit from the unit due to high traffic in the area especially during the Bowl Concerts and evening events as well as regular rush hour. The unit was clean with 3 bedrooms all with nice linens and 2 full bathrooms.  The mattresses were great quality and firm. The towels provided were high quality as well.  The dining room table fit our family of 5.  With 3 teen kids in our party we were very conscienous about the downstairs neigbors.  The floors are wood , but there are carpets in the high traffic areas to reduce noise.  We stayed 6 nights and were out of the unit from morning until night so we did not use the tv area or kitchen that often.  Angelina contacted us during our stay to make sure everything was ok, which was very nice.  The unit has air conditioning that helped during the LA heat wave.  Since the weather was warm, we did not take advantage of the outdoor seating, but it looked very welcoming. We felt very secure in the home. We would recommend this home and Angelina as a host.",en

We needed to extend our stay and she was nice enough to adjust the rate for us. The biggest hang up we had was the AC was unreliable. Since our visit was in August, it was pretty tough to handle.

1089331,8458599,2013-11-01,6708676,Robin,"The place was compact and useful and about 100 paces to the beach, which is cool. Tile floors which allowed me to avoid dusty carpets. 450sqft is small and the kitchen area is small but it is all about trade offs. The unit is well laid out. Parking is generally ok. In a 90-day span, my place was taken by others 3 or 4 times, which was incredibly annoying. But the landlord gave me alternatives in neighboring buildings he owns. I wish he put up ""do not park"" signs though.  Inside, it does get pretty damp and occasionally smelled as such. In-unit laundry was great. Overall, it was good for 3 months, though I wouldn't have enjoyed much longer than that ... I'm sure others could make do. If you want to be close to the beach, this was very good. ",en

The unit is centrally located, so it was as easy for us to get to the San Fernando valley as it was to get to Disneyland, which were our various destinations.  The only potential downsides would be, first, note there is no TV.  This would usually not be an issue for us, but on the day we arrived, the US womens soccer team was playing in the world cup, and we had to log on to the internet to see it.  Also, note; there is no door to the bathroom in the master bedroom. The above are minor issues.  The unit is fabulous, and just as advertised.",en

Cottage feel, rustic chic. My partner and I had enough room to cook, live, and work comfortably. Not recommended for more than two people. Before moving in, it wasn't clear to us that the bed is in what most people call the breakfast nook. But it does have a curtain, and gets sunlight most of the day, so we got used to it alright. The compound property has friendly neighbors and feels safe at all times. It's surrounded by plants, and has a shabby but usable patio. Daily street parking was fairly easy for LA standards.I would recommend this place to someone looking for a cozy place to stay in a trendy, friendly neighborhood. ",en

But definitely the best part of this experience was meeting Ryan; is a very kind person and extremely helpful to the needs of the traveler; he has always tried to find everything I needed and made me feel at home. He introduced me to his friends, who are really great people, and made sure that I felt comfortable in a foreign city. He took me camping with him and his friends, he invited me to have dinner at his parents house and see beautiful concerts, in two months, we have formed a true friendship.

Made some wonderful friends here and Alex the manager is incredibly helpful and friendly. As many other reviews note, the internet is spotty and sometimes quite poor.

In general the online description is accurate in relation to the actual place. In other words, no surprises (which for me is a good thing). The building is in a calm and very pleasant location. One of the highlights is the metro station, barely 5 min walking distance!   Alex, the manager of the facilities is always on point with his job and goes out of his way to make you feel comfortable and has a great disposition when your in need of info about the area or what to do around LA.  If I visit LA in the future I would definitely like to stay here again. All in all, a pleasant experience.",en

It can feel unsafe and even unfit for habitation in hot weather. Extremely hot and also extremely noisy. I wouldn't say it's cheap based on how low the quality is, but it is very private and Arts District is a nice area... and I guess you get used to the shabby conditions.

It's very like many places I've stayed in Europe, a bit like a hostel but with private bedrooms and a quiet, chill vibe for mature people who need to sleep at night and get up to go to work in the morning--the building is older (historic 1930s) with very simple accommodations, new Ikea furniture and linens, and shared hall bathrooms and downstairs kitchen/dining area (that are cleaned every morning), and there's an onsite coin laundry and common area. Esther was a friendly and excellent communicator, and while I didn't cross paths with too many other guests or residents, the ones I did meet were all courteous and low-key.  I am an artist and work on projects in Los Angeles, and I was both super comfortable and able to afford to stay for a few weeks--it was exactly what I needed, not bling-bling luxury but safe, clean, quiet, friendly, affordable and convenient.

Great nearby restaurants, but I as a fast walker I also could be in dlLA in around 20 minutes.   Lyft/Uber and electric scooters are readily available if you prefer.   Host(s): Even over the holiday's the host responded quickly to a minor issue.      Check-in and check out were easy.

They even gave us some flowers at the beginning and invited us for tea and cookies, so nice! The Hollywood Hills are a very nice and safe area.

Before even mentioning anything about how amazing this place is, I have to confess that Julie and Barry are some of the exceptional persons I've had the chance to meet. Such kindness is rare, they made me feel at home and were always available when I needed some help with something. The studio is huge, everything is at hand (it's a real plus to have a washing machine and a powerful dryer when you're living somewhere for more than a month!) The bed is very confortable, and of course, just like many people said in the previous comments, the view is unbelievable ! You don't need to go to Mullholand Dr. for sightseeing, just go and look through your window !!  You can always park in front and the neighbours are very nice as well.Finally, I loved this place and Julie/Barry so much, that I would definitely stay here forever if I could :) Thanks again to them so much!",en

The location is great and the home was perfect for our one night's stay.  We found that we spent most of our time in the backyard which is private and very cozy.

Both Futons were OK, but the thin and lumpy pillows were not nice.I was dissapointed to learn that no hairdryer was provided.We noted some bugs (spider in the living room, Daddy long legs in the kitchen, silverfish in the Bathroom). Since the kitchen window had no screen and the home had no A/C, it is understandable.Lastly, the fridge was dirty and left no room for even a soda (Website hidden by Airbnb) ",en

The home, grounds, and location are fabulous, and the photos don't quite capture the beauty and quaintness of the property. The photos make some things look more distant than they are; for instance, the patio table is quite close to the house, and we used it multiple times. The upper gardens are so whimsical, with unexpected shapes and objects in the brickwork throughout. The swimming pool is beautiful, but pretty cold. The access to the beach and the view of the coastline couldn't be better. From the house and the lawn we could watch the ocean all day. The house is well laid-out. The center bedroom held all four of the kids (with one on an air mattress), the only drawback being that the sliding doors did not screen out our kitchen noise. The painted walls and floors were charming and beautiful, and the entire house was nice and clean, just as expected. If you love dogs, then Pinky will visit you; if you don't, the hosts keep her in their spaces. The three rental units on the property each have their own outdoor spaces, the large lawn being reserved for the 3 bedroom house. Toni introduced guests to each other as appropriate, so that we could know who was who and interact casually. To sum up, we loved everything about this property, mostly the gorgeous location and the beautiful, whimsical house and grounds. We are already talking about a return trip!!",en

The neighborhood is quiet and close to both the 110 and 10 freeways and there is a nice market down the street. Would definitely recommend just about anyone to stay with Allen (and his very friendly cat and dog). ,en

We arrived at an obscenely late time, and Allen was there to cheerfully greet us and welcome us into his home as if it were 9am instead 1am.

Allen is a nice person who likes to share time and food with his guests, and very accommodating with requests. He also accepted to host two friends of us for few nights for free. However, the apartment is not the one shown in the pictures (they seem to be from another apartment from the same building). The apartment is less clean than what we expected compared with other experiences we had in the US. We didn’t like dirty kitchenware left around and in the sink for days, clothes and other stuff left on the floor in the common areas that made hard our attempts to clean around. If you don’t mind a massy place, we can recommend you Allen’s place for short stays, 14 days at most, but definitely not for long terms. If we had to stay there longer we would probably have looked for a different solution. ",en

The location was great too. It was located close to shopping and entertainment.The host was more than hospitable. He went out of his way to ensure that we had everything that we needed.

The neighborhood is very safe and peaceful and the house is within a short walk of the many shops and restaurants in Palisades village.     I had just about everything I needed and when I didn't, the agency was very prompt in responding to questions and requests. The agency also worked with me on the cost and the check-in time quite flexibly (Website hidden by Airbnb) loved that the place retains an early-to-mid 20th century feel (even with some newer fixtures) and was not ultra-modern like many nearby homes, though it is up-to-date with good WiFi service.

We had an elevator that took us from garage to our home.  We thought it was going to be a tight fit for the 7 of us, but it turns out that the loft is almost a bedroom in itself.  It had a large pull out sleeper sofa (queen).  The teens loved it.  We put another air mattress under the staircase.  This place would sleep 8 very comfortably.  Check-in was made easy with a wonderful next door neighbor (Hi Nune).  The communication with Paris was wonderful and always prompt.

She understood my dilemma and assured me that I would like her place. Well I did NOT like her place. ""I LOVED HER PLACE.""  Paris made sure someone greeted me at the door with the house keys and garage remote. Her home was everything she said it would be and then some. Upon walking in, we felt the cool air of her home that is centrally cooled. It was very thoughtful of her to make sure it was on for us since it was hot in L.A. that day. Her home in Glendale is ideally centrally located to shopping, restaurants, nightlife and more. We went for a nice walk at night and wound up eating at a great Mexican restaurant nearby.

My daughter and 2 other college aged girls needed a place to stay in Los Angeles during the course of their College Internships.  After seeing many other rentals in the area, I decided to make one last stop—Simon’s home.  The beautiful bungalow is on a quiet street shouldered by other lovely homes.  The ability to have two parking passes on the street (almost always able to park in front of the house) was really a luxury.  The area is absolutely in the heart of everything—grocery stores, boutiques, restaurants/bars all are are within walking distance.   The combination of being on a quiet street, and being so close to the hip/trendy areas of West Hollywood was more than a bonus.  The home itself could not have been more accommodating—The bedrooms and bathrooms were sparkling clean and well-appointed.  The kitchen was completely furnished with anything a guest could ever need.  The home has central Air- which was a relief during this summers’ heat-wave!I would, Hands-Down, recommend Simon’s home to any future guest wishing to have a peaceful, safe, high-end home to return to after experiencing all of what LA has to offer.

This sweet, tiny house is situated on a lovely large grassy, landscaped lot and it was stunningly peaceful, quiet,  intimate and authentic; perfect for an 11-day staycation (father-son visit). The decor was bohemian-aesthetic, incorporating vintage furniture & light-fixtures (the lamps were to die for!),  global textiles, and was handsome and well-considered. The beautiful refurbished O'Keefe and Merritt stove worked perfectly and allowed us to cook together, etc. As is often the case in historic homes, the two bedrooms are separated by a set of glass doors—ideal for us as it provided connection and privacy at the same time. On a couple of hot days we simply switched on the ceiling fans and opened some windows which was old school and super sweet. On cool evenings the heater worked fast to warm things up. Location was perfect too: close enough to walk to new & lively hotspots/restaurants/boutiques but not so close we could hear the good-natured revelry. Judy's towel and dishes game was strong too, basic brand new whites everywhere—love that. I'd definitely recommend this spot.",en

Kareen was so nice and met us to show us around the place and she left us some fruit and wine. The location is very convenient to Silver Lake and Los Feliz. A wonderful find! Thanks Kareen!",en

The outside space is also amazing, sadly the rain meant I couldn’t enjoy it in the way I would have liked.... but the positive of that was that I got to hang out inside with Mr Chou Chou the cat who lives here. He is super sweet and low maintenance and just a fluffy snuggle bug. Any questions/issues I had was quickly and efficiently answered/dealt with by Kareen’s lovely co host Melis.The location is great with supermarkets and restaurants near by while the house is nice and tucked away and the road quiet.I loved staying here and will be looking this place up again in the future!!! 5 stars all the way!!!",en

You walk in one door to find yourself in a little entry with two more doors one for the unit on the top floor of the apartment and one for the bottom unit. This made it so you could hear everything going on above. Immediately upon entering the kitchen we noticed that the sink had been touched up with white spray paint where signs of wear were visible. Every dish had to be cleaned before use. Everything was genuinely unclean and well used. The description and photos of the “private outdoor space” were very misleading. The space was actually a communal walkway to the handyman’s storage area.  Chairs and patio set were placed in the middle of the walk way. But the location was great if you like to walk and going to the beach.  I also found a dirty bandaid in the folds of the futon,en

1223274,749513591,2021-04-17,50765880,Samuel,"I stayed here during COVID (Feb - mid-April 2021).  I have lived in LA for about 3 years and used it because I didn't want to get into a new apartment lease.  This AirBnb had a full kitchen and a good location which was hard to find, and a good price.  I wasn't expecting anything special given the price, but there were a few issues I ran into during my stay.The Good-1. Good location2. Full kitchen3. Diane is very quick and responsive to my issues/concerns4. Small touches like laundry detergent, laundry basket, and fabric softener5. Good size table for WFH during COVID6. Parking is great for LA!7. Diane let me check in earlyThe Bad1. When I checked in I noticed there were spiders (daddy-long legs) mostly dead and cob webs / spider webs in the corners of the ceiling throughout the apartment.  Either the unit hadn't been occupied in a while, or there was a spider problem.  Regardless I soon discovered there was a spider problem where I woke up multiple mornings to large daddy long legs by my head and spiders in the bathroom. Spiders/pests are expected on the ground level of an apartment, but the level of spiders in this unit definitely signified there was a problem.  Diane had an exterminator come and spider problem got a lot better.  I think it may have just been that time of year because I didn't see any spiders the last couple weeks.  Like many places in cities, there are silverfish.  I don't mind them except I did find them in the silverware drawer on multiple occasions.  This leads me to #22. The insides of cabinets drawers needed a wipe down.  There was dust hanging from some of the dishes.3. Bathroom had odor coming from it - sink / toilet.  Black mold seemed to build up quickly on toilet.  It didn't smell for the first few days but then it got quite odorous.4. The unit entrance is shared with a tenant above so there doesn't seem to be that much privacy.5.  No true outdoor private space as depicted in the photoOverall, if you are looking for a budget studio to stay in Santa Monica this does the job, but the unit does not seem to be well maintained.  Also if you are tall like I am, the bathroom mirror is right under the stairway to the unit upstairs so I had to crouch to see myself in the mirror.  There is another mirror to use in the bathroom that is eye level.",en

I stayed here for the month of August 2021 and overall the place was great! Don’t be freaked out by the spider problem from another review, they got it figured out clearly because I didn’t see a single one the entire time I was there. Pros: -	The location is great, plenty of parking and it’s a 15 minute walk to the beach-	Diane was an incredible and responsive host -	Full kitchen, I was pleasantly surprised by how much cookware/basics there was-	There were plenty of blankets and towels -	Laundry was easy – bring quarters -	Although the neighbor is building something and it was intermittently loud, it was mostly quiet. I worked from home the entire month and rarely had problemsCons: -	The place wasn’t dirty by any means, but it could use a deep cleaning -	There is a semi private outdoor space, it’s not totally private but I never saw another person there the entire month I stayed-	This place doesn’t have AC, which I knew before staying. I had to have the front windows open the entire time for air circulation, which was uncomfortable because the unit is on the first floor facing a private gated walkway and the bed is right next to the window.

Nate was great!  He met our friend and showed him around, and then checked in again the next day to make sure we had everything we needed.  He was very easy to get a hold of, and made this whole process very easy.  The place was perfect for 3 people - spacious and clean.  There is a Trader Joe's nearby, so we used the blender every morning and made smoothies - it was a nice perk and allowed us to feel at home! Nate made sure we had everything we needed, and the 3 TV's that play different sports stations were a HIT with the guys!  Pool area is small but gets good sun, and was perfect to relax at.

Nate is by far the WORST and most inconsiderate host I have ever encountered.  The location is great and if you are coming for a few days,  be my guest and enjoy your time here, but dealing with Nate has been awful.  Also, this apartment is not newly renovated, the AC broke TWICE, plumbers had to come more than once, all of the woodwork is in awful condition and door frames are dented  and chipped.  Also, the carpet kicks up more dust than anything I've ever seen.   I had an extended stay (around 9 months) but unfortunately a member of my family had been having a really tough time and my friend had passed away, so I had needed to go home.  I had put through AirBnb if I can leave about 5 days earlier than my stay and still pay for all but a day and a half (that was Airbnb's policy).  Nate reached out, I told him what happened and he said he'll think about it and let me know.  He never responded and when I asked later if that was ok, he said no and that he would have needed 30 days (I gave him 27).  I said ok, I understand your policy and left it alone (despite already paying $30,000 to him for my stay and simply asking for $200 since I would not be there and would like to be home with my family).  I was upset but moved on but then in the same breathe as telling me no, Nate said I would need to give him 4 afternoons of my last two weeks there for him to show the apartment to future renters.  Keep in mind this is an AirBnb, and of this while asking you not to tell the neighbors you are staying in an AirBnb so he doesn't get in trouble..  I asked if he can just do that when I left since I was very busy looking for a new home/work and with my personal life and he said no.  I understood he was having a child so I MOVED MY FLIGHT for him so I can have the apartment ready to show.  He did show it and then immediately asked for two more days the following week.  I gave him all of the next Friday to show the apartment despite feeling taken advantage of since I asked one simple thing from him which he denied, and now he's being inconsiderate and adding on to it (He was also very upset with me that  I could not give him more time to show it).  On top of that, he then had the gall to ask if I would still be leaving early so he can enter early after making me pay for the days.  I was so happy to be leaving until two days later he hits me with an additional $399 charge for damages.  The damage was a complete joke.  This tiny blemish on the fake wood table which was there when I arrived and I  have to purchase him a new table?!?! He wasn't even there to check me in or check me out and I had to pick up or leave keys elsewhere!  An obvious cash grab so PLEASE, take pictures of everything when you arrive because you will be dealing with an extremely cheap individual.",en

1240012,8753263,2013-11-16,5174028,Eric,"The Little Toyko dorm was perfect for my needs, surprisingly clean and quiet inside (almost library quiet), but the noise outside leads something to be desired. Pro: Very close to downtown LA and well situated.  It's in walking distance to the Arts District, Little Tokyo, Union Station.  If you like to walk, you can go to Grand Park (and the courts if so needed), Walt Disney Concert Hall, Grand Central Market, tons of restaurants.  The Gold line train is steps away, as well as the Dash A (which stops at the corner and goes to City View where you can find Target and other stores).  The building itself is very quiet.  The room is as described, rent is cheap, manager pleasant.  The place is surprisingly clean for the size and number of people. Everything was in working order.Con: While it looks cozy, the building is in need of major renovation (which appears to be going on). Wifi is a joke, some of the other renters are friendly, some barely speak.  The room is no frills.  The unfurnished rooms comes with nothing, not a hanger, or a mirror, or a table (don't know about the furnished rooms).  The windows are porous and depending on the room (I was in the two twenties not 106 due to some mix up???), if you are facing Hewitt you can forget about getting a late night sleep.  The Gold line train is just outside the window and as late as midnight and as early as the 5am you can hear the whistle and bells of the train (fortunately I had to be up early every morning) as it approaches the station.  In addition the sound of the Dash A can be heard as well.   The refrigerator situation is confusing (a renter posted a note about stolen food and I noticed my food may have been sampled) as is the use of the items in the kitchen. All in all, if you have to be downtown (or the artist district) and don’t have a lot of money to spend this could be the place for you.  ",en

The plants in the backyard are more interesting and beautiful that the pictures portray. Michal unexpectedly offered to drive us to the concert we flew in for.

I stayed there for the summer of 2017 while I interned at JPL, it was a 10 minute drive (3 miles away), and I have to say that Michal was the best host imaginable. He was extremely welcoming and kind, always very considerate of his guests, and he has a phenomenal sense of humor! I got to hear him sing a piece he composed a couple of times and it sent chills down my back because it was so heartfelt. He has an enormous collection of plants and beautiful antiques as well if you're interested in those. I have had a phenomenal summer and staying at Michal's house was a huge part of that. He's a great conversationalist and terrific host. I absolutely recommend staying with Michal, it's an enriching experience.

Furnished with good quality and quirky pieces, it's a really comfortable space with a lovely feel to it. Sally was the perfect host - I have nothing but good to say about her! When we arrived to kitchen was missing a few items which would have been useful for our relatively long stay (we have a young toddler hence tend to stay in during the evenings and are keen cooks!) and Sallie provided these for us when asked really quickly and smilingly. She was always on hand to answer questions but never intrusive and Miranda the cat (we didn't meet the other one- shy puss!) was very lovely. The outside space is full of gorgeous mature trees, plants and flowers and will be great when finished (Sallie's in the process of putting a fire-pit in which will be fun). Personally, we'd have liked a more private space for our own use but that's just our preference. Location-wise it's really close to Melrose (great shopping, bars and restaurants) and very central for all LA has to offer. It's a lovely residential street just off posh Hancock park (with big, fancy houses you can stroll past doing the ""if I were really rich I'd buy that one"" game).

The location suited us very well, as it was reasonably proximate to the Getty Center, Dorothy Chandler and our friends and family in Beverly Hills and San Fernando Valley.

Nice and quiet, a short walk to groceries, restaurants and shops, and not too many crazies lurking around (for LA).I was here for work and my wife and kids came too. The area as great for them as there was a couple playgrounds and cafes nearby if they didn't want to drive. I could walk to 2 different Wework office locations every day within 15-30mins of this place so was super handy.Julie was super responsive and always got back to us promptly - we didn't need that much from her.We're a family of 4 and there were a couple of things that weren't kid friendly: everything was white which is fine if you're a couple staying for a weekend but not if you're a family staying for 2 months. Also the water feature outside was not enclosed so we couldn't leave our 2yr old play unattended.One thing was disappointing (Airbnb, not Julie) was that we had to leave 2 days early and despite Julie agreeing, Airbnb saw fit to keep this money.

Cons:1) The pictures on the website are cropped in a way hide the dimly lit interior, as well as the countless number of clocks, pens, flashlights, key chains, wristbands (etc.) that line the walls of the living room, main hallway, side hallways, and even the bathroom. Steve apparently has a manufacturing company and literally brings his work home with him. When my friend came to visit, she thought I had booked with a hoarder.2) Steve did not show up to book me in. This job was taken up by the Chinese caretaker of the house who spoke no English. He lives in an apartment with his family in the house. 3) The lack of English led to a miscommunication. I was given a remote to the front gate. I parked near the mouth of the driveway late one night and was awoken at 5:30 am by another guest because I was blocking his car. There is a 3 car park in the rear of the house that I was never shown. And the remote I was given was the ""house"" remote, not the personal remote mentioned in the booking description. Steve personally came to explain the parking situation and to provide me with a personal remote after my Chinese friend's parents called to complain.4) I was never told that other guests were staying in the house. I think this is very important to know since people will be sharing the bathroom, kitchen, and driveway. Conflicting schedules can lead to big problems. 5) The AC unit in my upgraded room sat in the window, which was hanging wide open. Sheets of foam insulation were loosely placed in the window, but it did not keep out the cold or the noise from the neighboring houses.",en

The room I was initially placed in had two doubles, enough to accommodate a family, which was much bigger than what I needed, but halfway through the stay I was moved to a different house with a single king, however the room much nicer than what I had expected. I definitely would have paid much more than what I did if I had reserved this room, so it was a very nice upgrade. This was due to him being overbooked, but I did not mind at all!",en

1278671,103664124,2016-09-23,37446229,Juen,"If you treat this as a hostel, then you won't be disappointed. It is not actually a room, but more of a makeshift room. Your door is attached to two bookshelves and the wall is just drapes. So you basically have zero noise cancellation from other tenants/guests. The room was really dusty/dirty, I had to wipe the desk twice until it is clean. Most of the other tenants were Mainlanders, so they DO NOT understand the concept of whispering at night. They woke me up around midnight knocking on each other doors and talking loudly. Parking was a hassle, I highly suggest you to purchase overnight parking permit if you are just staying for a several day. The price per night is $4 and you can purchase them online. Treat this as a hostel and you won't be disappointed. This place is definitely not a diamond in the rough.",en

The pictures do not give it enough justice, the home is BEAUTIFUL — full of intricacies and quirks that give it it's own special energy. It's hard not to fall in love with the southwest inspired and natural decor, and for vinyl enthusiasts like my partner and I, we were impressed and in awe of the great collection they have. Derek and Kristen were sweet and kind to us even after our late arrival, they gave us a tour and accommodated us with a few friends in the most comfortable and unique way possible. We honestly left there not wanting to leave. We loved it and consider it a dream home without a question. It's tucked away from the city but still close enough to enjoy it. The neighborhood is small, swervy roads that lead up what seems a whole different part of LA you don't get to see (we actually did spot a deer in the back hillside!). The atmosphere up there is an experience I'd recommend for anyone wanting to steer away from the typical visit to LA because walking into an earthy, warm, and welcoming place was more than I could have imagined.

It's the perfect canyon getaway, so peaceful and relaxing and yet just a couple of minutes from the action in Hollywood and beyond. This place is about as authentic as you can get, and it really brings you back into the golden years of the 1960s and 70s. We didn't want to leave. Even my father-in-law, who's from Paris and doesn't get effusive about anything, kept talking about how much he loved staying there. Derek, who greeted us at the house and showed us around, is very warm, friendly, and helpful. It was a true pleasure to meet him. We'd definitely stay here again. ",en

I stayed there with my GF for a little over a week and we both loved it. Located right near Santa Monica Blvd and Westwood Blvd( I hope I'm remembering those correctly lol) it is perfect for accessing public transportation. Whole foods is within walking distance and so is this taco food truck which is awesome and open late. Also, if you are up for it Merlin has bikes that can be used which is awesome! You can easily bike to the beach or take a quick bus ride down. One of the best malls in the area is near by. The neighborhood seems to be very safe and I never had any worries safety wise. He had Apple TV set up and Netflix which was nice and a full kitchen that I used daily which saved us a ton on food during our trip. Also, the bed was extremely comfortable and large (I am 6 ft 250 pounds) , my girlfriend and I slept comfortably and he even had a bunch of fans to keep you cool. What helped make my stay here amazing was being able to communicate with Merlin at any time via text or phone call. If I had any questions at all he was very quick to respond and gave me some awesome recommendations of places to visit and eat. He was also very accommodating although I booked pretty last minute and the price to rent his apartment is very fair and better priced then most places in that area and of that size. All in all it was a very enjoyable stay and Merlin and his apartment are in my opninion of the best in the area.

The only cons are that it got suuuuuper hot- it was always several degrees warmer indoors than it was outdoors, but Merlin had fans around the apt that helped a bit to keep us cool (and we cracked open some windows as well.) There is no on site laundry, which ultimately was not that big a deal, but it definitely would've been a big plus. My sister fell in love with the place, we really felt like it was our own.

Location was perfect for our side trips to Disneyland and Universal Studios and generally worked well for all of our LA area activities. It is a functioning household which offers the benefits of access to items that are not available in other rental homes but it does require some flexibility on the part of the renter to work around the hosts personal items.

Alice left a nice basket of goodies in the dining room for us to enjoy--cookies, candy, Starbucks coffee, and shower supplies. We parked our rental car in the driveway.

And this house made it to be a great addition to our trip. Days before we arrived, the host sent warmhearted greeting with local tips to us. Since we went to a road trip on Route 1, so by the time physically got there it was kinda a bit late and dark outside. What's grateful, they stayed late on that day and assisted us through the phone till the minute we made to enter the place. Don't get me wrong, actually their apt is easy to access and the way they manage a flexible check in/out is simple and amazing. Besides, we checked out the breakfast shop they recommended called Urth Café. I fall for the French Toast there. I was s (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) good. OMG.. And the bacon croissant is my friend's favorite.All in all, Keith & Yeva are hosting a great place. Highly recommend. So if you got chance to visit Santa Monica, here is the place to stay.  :)",en

We loved how the kitchen/dining area was open to the living room too. And since we had our baby with us it worked out perfectly that their second bedroom is a nursery (a really nice one!). They even had a Christmas tree all decorated which made it feel really homey. Would stay here again in a heartbeat and highly recommend it!

I booked the house the day before arriving (I don't recommend you do the same as it was a mess for him and his family and nerve-racking for me as we did not know if it was gonna be possible!). Peter answered to all my questions in the hour. With so much time difference between Europe and LA it could have been complicated but it was in fact very easy to communicate. Upon arrival Peter gave me a great tour of the house and showed me how to make the best coffee (very important!). I instantly felt like at home. My 8 month old baby loved it too. With so many toys to play with and 2 cats he was delighted to be there. He slept really well (probably the longest he has ever slept in months) as the house is very quiet. We had an amazing time and really enjoyed the garden, staying on the patio for morning coffee or red wine...The house was very clean and everything is well organised. There's everything you need and even more. Loved the way it's decorated. It's got a great mix of furniture. Neighbourhood is great also. You're a short distance on the bike (loved Peters bikes) from Abbott Kinney, the beach, cools restaurants and shopping. It's the perfect house if you have kids. If the perfect house full stop. I should probably not say all this as I want the house to be free next time I come over to LA!Thanks again Peter for making my stay possible. ",en

There are some things to consider. It's next to a busy street, so there is a lot of noise coming in day and night. I would open the window occasionally, buts it loud to sleep with it open. Another potential annoyance is that the apartment is full of college students. Some neighbors occasionally throw weekend parties that get kind of rowdy. It only got annoying once in two months. Some good stuff:The kitchen is stocked full of supplies. I'm not much of a cook, but its enough for the pickiest of eaters. The fridge has plenty of space too. I loved the dinning room table; might not seem all that important but it was nice to start off my day eating breakfast there. It's comfy, clean and well lit.The bathroom is very clean. It has a big mirror and decent sized shower.Internet speeds are great. Nancy upgraded it in the middle of my stay, which was a big improvement.Access to transit is easy; its right next to the most frequent bus line (Metro 240). It's about 10 minute walk to/from CSUN.

I was sad to say goodbye to Peter, Diane and Rugby but happy to have made two (three) new wonderful friends! ",en

They are so knowledgeable about the LA area and are more than happy to help you find exactly what you're looking for whether it be a good bar, restaurant, event, etc. The house is spacious, comfortable and welcoming-- I really felt at home.  I was having a hard time adjusting to living somewhere completely new and Peter and Diane were always there to help talk me through what I was going through and immediately asked if there was anything they could do to make their home more of a safe space for me as I was adjusting. Not only were they great hosts, but also great friends. The neighborhood of Silver Lake was safe, vibrant and beautiful-- I felt comfortable going for a walk at any time of day. Plus, it was so easy to get to Downtown LA and West Hollywood!  I am so happy that I had the privelege of living with Peter, Diane (and Rugby!) this summer and I would absolutely recommend this listing.",en

They are wonderful, friendly, and genuine people who are very accommodating and make you feel at home right away but will also always respect your privacy. You can rely on their inside tips and knowledge of the city to help you make the best of your LA experience and I remember many great, inspiring, and vivid evening conversations I had with Diane about anything and everything during my time there. Also, Rugby is a gem of a dog: friendly and calm and always up for a snuggle.As many have noted before, Diane and Peter’s house, the patio, and the room are beautiful and truly felt like a sanctuary of peace and quiet to come home to in the evenings after an activity packed day in sprawled out LA. Equipped with all amenities, everything is clean, the bed is comfy, and the adjacent private bathroom is very convenient.I have stayed in different parts of LA before and I would say that in terms of location, I personally cannot imagine a more ideal place to stay in the city. Vibrant yet safe and peaceful, Silver Lake is the perfect neighborhood to get a feel for what it might be like to live in LA. It hosts some of the best cafés, restaurants, shopping, bars, and clubs of the city and the house is nestled in perfect (walking!) proximity to all of it.I thus wholeheartedly recommend this listing and I would stay with Diane and Peter again in a heartbeat!",en

I was welcomed with a hot cup of tea, lots of local area advice, and quick responses to any questions I had about the room.  Diane went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable - for example, my (normally minor) allergy to feathers started acting up and she immediately swooped in with fresh pillows and blankets.  One evening was chilly and Diane brought by a space heater in case I wanted a few extra degrees.  They also were able to give me lot of advice on the neighborhood and parks.  I very much recommend staying with them!",en

Peaceful, book-filled home with original features and sun-trap garden. Quiet neighbourhood with great walking around the charming local streets.

For the past month you guys were my home and family away from home, so writing you a review is kind of weird in that sense. But I would try to be informative for the sake of other readers who are interested in this lovely home. I’ll start by saying that the pictures on the website were accurate and even underestimating the beauty of Peter and Diane’s home. The room I stayed in was cozy and nice, with enough storage place, the bed and linens were comfy and nice, and the room has private bathroom with all the amenities. There is absolute privacy and for the most part it felt like I have my own apt.Peter and Diane really went out of their way to make me feel welcome and a part of the family.I would summarize by saying that I would definitely come to stay with them the next time I’ll be in LA, and I guess it says it all.Thank you guys so much!",en

The room is elegantly designed, with style and comfort in mind, as well as a sense of privacy when you need to tuck yourself away. Every morning I would wake up looking forward to cup of coffee from Peter, insightful conversations with Diane and eating my breakfast bowl in the lovely garden patio. Their Silverlake home is rich with character, filled with books and mementos from their travels, photographs and art. I have found new friends, yet feel like I've known Peter & Diane for years, they invited me on day trips out and about in LA, evenings for dinner and wine tasting, and of course I had the most fun joining them for game nights watching the playoffs :) There's plenty to do around Silver Lake whether you're taking a walk around the reservoir or just heading over to Sunset. I'm definitely looking forward to staying again on my next visit to LA - can't imagine anywhere else I'd rather be.",en

I don't know where to start... it felt like a whole new world within Los Angeles opened up for me on this trip and I left inspired and full of energy and ideas. Coming back to SilverLake felt like coming back home, the house is as wonderful as ever and with even more books to savour. Peter and Diane are riveting company and I thoroughly enjoyed our trips to Malibu, seeing exhibitions, hikes to Griffith Park, many nights out and am keeping a surplus of wonderful memories with me as I look forward to returning back again. Conversations with Peter and Diane are always enriching and insightful, and I have learned so much through their vast knowledge and innate curiosity. The highlight for me is the joy and humour that they bring to every moment, and their ability to make light of life. Silverlake is a perfect base with more and more local spots opening nearby and plenty of opportunities to go for a walk - which is always more enjoyable when it's with Rugby. I can't wait to come back in the Spring!  I miss you guys and truly cherish our friendship.",en

She accepted my reservation after we talked and she used her break from work to let me in. That's above and beyond. My room was clean and put together when I got there, and even though it was a last minute reservation she super cleaned the common spaces I'd be using too (kitchen and bathroom). The location was brilliantly, most of what I was doing was right in Hollywood and it was just a short walk away. Definitely recommend this place.

I found Tati to be a great host: she is a friendly and helpful person as well as a safe host; she communicates well and responds quickly. The accommodation offers a great location, next to a bus line (#210) or 20 minutes (walking) distance to the Hollywood Blvd and a Metro station (Hollywood/Vine). The street is friendly and quiet, and there are drugstore + convenience stores nearby. The building and the apartment themselves are old and haven't been refurbished in a long time. The place is great if you want to experience living in an old Hollywood house (think the opening scenes of “La La Land”, only without the fake glamour and with a more bohemian atmosphere).

If you do stay here I would suggest bringing a mattress cover, clean sheets, towels, and your own soap. Her mattress is a dark grey color, I don't think she washes sheets between people, and she doesn't provide towels whatsoever. Also, if you plan to stay for a while, do a test night or week. I had problems with bugs and the apartment was much dirty than I expected. So like I said, only stay here if you absolutly need to. Tatiane is nice, but her apartment needs some serious work. ",en

If you’re someone like me who can’t bear untidiness and a messy place, this isn’t a good fit for you.Pictures don’t look like the actual place that much. When I got to the room, I was a little shocked to see stains on the walls. Most furniture pieces were covered in dust (I have bad allergies). Closet was full of old stuff too. The door was pretty much falling apart, knob didn’t even work even properly (it would come off).Bathroom was no exception. Bottles and dust everywhere. She had a bathtub but did make it clear that it wasn’t in the listing as it was filled with stuff, which I’m not complaining about. Shower was messy as well.The kitchen you see in the pictures is covered in dust and sticky stuff. There was no way I was going to cook any meals there :(I knew I wouldn’t be able to spend a night in such a messy space, so I ended up contactIng Airbnb just a few hours after I got to Los Angeles. I probably should have discussed these issues with Tatiane before proceeding to do anything but the entire place was dirty. After they contacted her over my issue, she got upset (which is understandable) and told me that “her place wasn’t a 5 star hotel, it was just a shared space”. I strongly believe this is no excuse to have a clean enough place If you’re charging people actual money to stay at your premises.I feel a little bad leaving this review, as Tatiane is a really sweet girl and even gave me a hand with my luggage to get it all upstairs. Location is nice, but hygiene really needs to be improved. Having said all of this, I wouldn’t recommend this place unless it gets cleaned thoroughly, fresh coat of paint for walls and a new door. By no means am I trying to offend Tatiane, again, she is really nice, but she definitely needs to improve the way she carries her space.",en

Her home is as described, beautiful and unique and the views are breathtaking- from the kitchen you can see the Hollywood sign and from the front patio downtown LA is there for your eyes to feast on. My group and I spent many hours on the front terrace, enjoyed the fragrant jasmine blossoms, and watched the sun and fog play on the DTLA skyline. The house is not only comfortable and clean, but you also feel like you could close your eyes and imagine living there, that you could wake up in the California King bed, make a cup of coffee, and this could be your own place to call home. or at least that is how I felt every morning! A real home away from home. I would recommend staying here as a group or for family vacations as there is enough space to not feel cramped, and for everyone to have their own area to put their feet up and relax. The kitchen was well stocked for cooking meals and the basement has laundry services. The neighborhood of Echo Park is a great location to visit itself and also a central point to see much of the rest of the LA area. I would recommend using uber to get around- from Echo Park to Downtown cost around $8 one way which was very convenient for our group that was traveling there every day for a conference at the convention center. I will definitely look to see if Martineke's home is available for our next trip to LA! 5+ stars",en

There is a starbucks about a mile away, which gets pretty crowded, but has a nice vibe, and Albertson's. There are a couple of Whole foods a short drive away.

I have Airbnbd three times long term in Los Angeles waiting to find the perfect apartment and my experience here was unnerving. Ben promoted long term living but the place felt more like a jail. He also wanted to hang out multiple times and made me feel very uncomfortable even though he wasn't in the house. Then when leaving, he left me a detailed Cinderella cleaning list to follow which I showed to even my employer .. Who too thought it was unrealistic.

1392920,344499672,2018-11-03,78004929,Hallie,"Very pretty unit with nice detailing and décor. Plenty of amenities (incl. extra towels), and the washer/drier is a huge bonus too. Big closet with lots of hangers. TV has Netflix. Bed is comfortable. Shower pressure is good. Bathroom counter is on the smaller side. Sturdy kitchen table and comfortable chairs (good for working on a laptop, though there is also a small desk I didn’t use). The backyard is a wonderful place to sit outside day or evening (daytime, there is plenty of shade from palm trees and umbrellas). You are essentially staying on the lower unit of the owners’ house with your own private entrance, but you come and go through the back gate so it really feels like your own place. Because the unit is on the lower level and the yard is very private with fences/hedges, the unit does not get very much natural sunlight through the windows, which may or may not matter for you. The designated parking spot is very good – super easy to get in and out of. The location is great whether you are here for business or fun. It’s right next to the 101 freeway, Ventura Blvd, and Universal Studios. Plenty of great restaurant options and a gas station right at the corner.While it’s a gorgeous neighborhood (very lower part of the Hollywood Hills on the valley side), the hills are generally not a fantastic place for walking/running because there are no sidewalks and it’s very narrow with lots of curves. Normally that would be a drawback for me, but in this case, the location is soooo close to some of the best hiking spots in LA. You are a 10 minute drive from the top entrance of Runyon Canyon and almost just as close to Wilacre Park and Fryman Canyon. So this is a fantastic place to stay if you are a hiker or walker. The very short drive to those places is easy and worth it. Owners are very nice and even though you are staying on their property, it feels very private. I only saw them a few times and the backyard was always empty. The only drawback for me is that the house is hardwood floors, so you will hear footsteps above your head sometimes (and I am a light sleeper).Overall, a very nice rental. One of the best I’ve stayed at when I come to business for LA, and I’ve stayed many places. It’s very good value for the price!",en

Nb: very comfortable beds. Unfortunately, the swimming pool was full of algae! It was not blue but green. We could not use it. Obviously, the pool had not been checked prior to our coming (a thick algae layer does not develop within just a few days). Ravi is reactive to emails and effective for emailing info on the house & all. But we never met with him. And the issue for us is that such an algae problem could not be solved quickly enough for our benefit.  Finally, Ravi offered to give us access to another pool a 10mn drive away. As having a nice swimming pool at hand was a key criterion for choosing this house (look at the ""selling"" picture on Airbnb, my children had dreamt about it), we're now requesting a discount for the rental.

Their home didn't feel like a hotel and my stay didn't feel like a business transaction. We talked all of the time, I played with their awesome dog everyday and we exchanged stories, laughs and even food! They fully respected my privacy as I did theirs, which is super important when living in someone else's house. Their neighbors are awesome, and the neighborhood is quiet, crime-free and a quick bus ride to the airport or to Culver City. I absolutely loved staying with them!

They drove me around the neighborhood when I first arrived to help me orient myself. They made sure I knew where I was going and that I would be safe getting there. Over the summer we went hiking, had meals together and great conversation. They are fun to be around, and among the nicest people I have met. Their home is beautiful, the neighborhood is safe and relatively easy to  get to. I went to LA not knowing anybody, and left with two great friends. I would not think twice about going back! ",en

They provided me with some great tips about the local area such as where to buy groceries, where to get a car wash, and great hiking trails.  They own a dog who is friendly and energetic, but he'll need a day or two to get used to you.  The room I stayed in was spacious enough to fit my car load (clothes, camera equipment, some small furniture) I brought cross-country.

I will say I did work nights so sometimes it was hard to sleep during the day due to noise.  I was not allowed to use the kitchen to cook.

It is basically right on the hill above Sunset, with cool bars and restaurants in walking distance (Alimento, Mohawk Bend, Tiki Ti, Intelligentsia).  Because their place is right above Sunset, you will definitely have noise from the street, but it is more of an ambient noise.  I'm a light sleeper and did not have any real issues, but if you need absolute quiet, something to consider.  In addition, their place is on a hill with narrow streets and parking can be tough, so if you are not confident in your driving / parallel parking skills, something to consider.

It's hard to describe just how magical this place is: private and soothing, an airy sun-filled bungalow surrounded by a zen garden full of flowers, smack in the middle of West Hollywood yet somehow utterly serene. Nights are silent and smell of warm jasmine, and I slept like a baby on the cloud-like bed under skylights with a view of palm trees and the moon. In the morning, sweet little birds chattered over coffee on the private patio. On occasion, Sula the feline hostess honored me with her presence, lolling in the sunshine while I read my novel. In the bathroom there’s a clawfoot soaker tub, warm tile floors, a chandelier, and candles. The bookshelf is full of literary delights, from Rilke to French poetry to fascinating memoirs. There’s an enormous lovely old oak desk looking out on the garden, so I actually wanted to do my work. This honestly feels like the kind of place that could cure writer’s block or a broken heart, or both at once. I loved cooking in the well-stocked kitchen, shopping local farmers’ markets, and walking around this historic neighborhood full of fantastic restaurants, shops, parks and living history. Katherine is truly a superhost! She was warm and welcoming, genuinely kind and thoughtful. She went above and beyond to make me feel at home and to provide the few extra items I asked for.

I ended up with an extra ticket to FYF, so she went with and we ended up hanging out, rocking out to some great music, having some great vegan food, and having some generally great times.

The apartment is small (about 500 sq. ft.), ideal for a single person or a young couple who doesn't know better (my situation) but the location makes up for the lack of leg room. It is 50 feet away from an incredible beach.The one problem we had was that the parking situation wasn't mentioned to us prior to moving in. There is no free parking. The fee is $150 / month per car to park across the street in a beach lot. Because of our initial miscommunication of the matter, Ninfa and the owner agreed to cut the fee in half for us which was incredibly kind. I would recommend this place to those looking to pay for the proximity to the beach, and to some great shopping at third street.",en

We had to buy some new kitchen supplies. Although we were not at home and not allowed the owner, they entered the house because of water leaking problem. Parking and grocery shopping are problem because the nearest supermarket is approximately 1 km ahead. And the bed is king size but it’s comfort is poor size.

If you're an early riser, you can park right in front of the building (just have to move by 7am in the mornings). Otherwise you can park a couple blocks north of the apt without issue.Just a couple of flags... There is no large common space (only a kitchen table), so if you're looking to lounge around on a couch, it's not so great for that. Water pressure in the shower is kinda low.

The room was a great size , and while it was on a busy street, the noise wasn't too bad. I didn't have a car with me, but there was a bus stop just outside the front door, and I was able to walk to groceries and restaurants (about 15 minutes walk). Very easy to get to DTLA, Hollywood and super close to hiking trails (like the Observatory!). George was so welcoming and provided great hospitality during my stay. It was such a nice surprise to see items from fresh linens to Halloween treats outside my door each week. Thank you George!",en

I stayed with George a month and I really enjoyed it.  Here are my thoughts.The neighborhood is great.  It was definitely my favorite part of the stay.  It's within walking distance of a lot of restaurants and cafes, also it was a very friendly neighborhood.  The accommodations.   The room is very good size and the bed is really comfortable.  I stayed there a whole month and didn't get claustrophobic at all, which can happen to me.  The shower is amazing with lots of hot water.  The kitchen is simple and has what you need to cook basic meals.  The apartment and building are clean, but it's an older place and looks a little worn.The host.  George is very nice.  I think we had opposite hours so I didn't see him that much.  I didn't need any special attention so it was cool with me.  Any question I did have he was able to answer.  He was also very accommodating.",en
1588977,155684253,2017-05-28,47682270,Susann,"George is the best host I've ever had. He did everything to make my stay as enjoyable as possible. I stayed at his place for my first month in LA after relocating. I didn't have to care about anything, so I could concentrate on finding a permanent place and get settled in the city. He literally shared his whole place, meaning that I could use whatever I needed in the common areas. He provided everything I could have asked for and even more. He also helped me with any question I had, recommend places to go to and even took care of me when I was sick. Not only is George the perfect host, but the place is perfect as well, if you're searching for a nice and safe neighborhood. Metro buses ( (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) ) will pick you up right in front of the house and bring you to Hollywood. There are also really nice restaurants and bars within walking distance. If you want to go for a hike and enjoy one of the most breathtaking views of LA, go to nearby Griffith Park. I absolutely recommend George and his place! ",en

1622172,506539780,2019-08-10,274589583,John,"We never actually saw the room we booked. He put is in three different rooms through out our first week there. The first two were tolerable and in his main house. However communication was almost impossible and uncomfortable for English speakers. Once we got to the room we were supposed to be in, he said it was the biggest he had and walked away. What he didn’t mention is we would be responsible for washing the dishes in room that weren’t ours so we could eat. The room we were in though didn’t have kitchen access like promised so we had to wash all the dishes in the bathroom sink. The rest of the room, held up the same decor. Dust and dirt covered the walls and floors, hair and grime in the bathtub so bad we couldn’t use it- or dare to. There was dried bubblegum heaps on the tile, and cockroaches so infested we found them in bed with us and had to sleep on a one person fold out bed for the remainder of our month stay. With about two weeks left on our stay a hornets nest formed on the front door, which the owner tried to “take away” himself. It just kept rebuilding and every day we spent the next 8 hours fighting to get in and out of the room without being stung. I tried really hard to give this host the benefit of the doubt and ask for help. Maybe if you speak Chinese he can be more understanding and caring. But for me it was one big problem after another. The list of problems with our stay goes on, the owner barged in on us at 10pm when we were in our underwear and started walking around our room, they threatened to call the cops on us because we were loud for 25-30 minutes at most when we had been quiet as a church mouse our whole stay. Unfortunately that’s not the end of it, but this is a warning not a saga. Just be careful before you book. This host burned us bad, and expected us to thank him for it.",en

Being close to Hollywood Blvd, Sunset Blvd & Highland Ave is very convenient and nearest park (Runyon Canyon) is beautiful.As for the apartment itself, it was clean, not a big one, but was sufficient for us as we were a group three friends (2+1) concerned about a place to rest between trips to various attractions. There weren't any problems with contacting our host or organizing a futon for our friend (which he mentioned was very comfortable :) ) There is a nice bonus to the studio - fire escape next to your window with a really nice view of the Hollywood Hills. The building also has a nice little garden which was always empty and we felt like the only people who used it. Only con that comes to mind was really slow elevator.",en

Very close to Hollywood Blvd.- Mark the manager was friendly and dropped by to say hi and bye on the first and last day.  I emailed him a few times when we were there and he responded promptly.- Easy to follow instructions, easy access to the apartment, and great parking, which is well worth the cost.- There IS a small elevator in the building (not sure why it's not listed under Amenities)CONS (minor)- The suite was SO HOT when we arrived the first day even with the portable AC unit at full blast!  We soon figured out what the problem was - the AC filter was clogged with dust.  After we clean it, the AC worked more efficiently.- The apartment was actually darker that what's depicted in the photos.  A few pieces of furniture were slightly different and the microwave was actually on a metal cart and not built-in.- We were expecting the washer/dryer to be in the apartment itself but they were actually in the basement and they took quarters.

It is located on a quieter street just steps from Hollywood Blvd and the metro station. We walked a lot of places. There are great restaurants within walking distance well. 2) The place is very clean.3) Mark, the manager is nice and helpful.CONS -We got to see Mark the manager so much because there were so many maintenance issues with this place.   1) THE BED is old and falling apart     * The bed slats kept falling through and when we tried to fix them we saw they had previously been duct-taped several times. Every time we went to sit on the bed to get in, the edges popped through and the mattress sagged to the floor.  * The mattress is very uncomfortable and hard. There is no protective cover on the mattress. The sheets and comforter are worn out and old. The elastic on the fitted sheet is stretched and the sheet kept coming off during the night.2) NO HEAT  * The first two nights we were there the temperatures  were in the 40s and it was cold in the apt and the heat did not come on. The building manager came and lit the pilot light. Then the heater was smoking, burning off the paint or whatever, and the unit filled with smoke and the smoke alarm was set off. We were not able to heat the apartment that night and had to sleep in sweats.3) NO HOT WATER IN SHOWER   * The hot water in the shower was tepid and we had to take cool showers the first 2 days until the plumber came and fixed it.4) NO AIR CONDITIONER  *By our fourth day there it got very hot and the air conditioner did not cool at all. It was a portable unit. The maintenance man came and looked at it and said it was full of water and needed emptying. He took it and emptied it but it still never got the room cool. There was a note on it warning us not to lower the temp or we would be liable for the damages.. I was sweating the last two nights we were there. I was also sweating when we were trying to get ready for dinner. The temp in the room was 79. So, if you like it cooler than 79, you're out of luck.  The building manager Mark was nice and came to see about us when we called, but it really became aggravating that we had to deal with the manager daily, as well as a plumber, and maintenance people while trying to enjoy a vacation.",en

Instantaneous hot water! Even during the pandemic, I was pleasantly surprised by  the quietness of the building. What a respite! The large screen TV, sleeper sofa, closet space, and bistro dining area made self-isolating that much easier.  They were very kind when I needed to extend my stay.

The bed was just okay, but I was happy that it was a queen size (I'm rather tall, so hang off a full-size bed) and there was also a futon that looked like it could be made into a bed.  The bathroom is small, but adequate and it was great to have access to wifi.You can access the room by a private entrance by going up some fire escape steps (it's easy, but narrow), or Jedda is happy to give access through the main house during daytime hours when she is around.  She was very accommodating and was clearly eager to ensure I enjoyed my stay.  She noted that the room was a bit chilly, so offered a space heater.  I chose not to take it, as there was plenty of bedding to keep warm at night and I wasn't planning to be around much during the day.

1633204,7895033,2013-10-07,8903748,Paul & Jess,"I visited Los Angeles for 8 days earlier this month, and am thoroughly glad I chose to stay with Linda! She was simply the most delightful, thoughtful and friendly host, and really helped to make my stay in LA easy, enjoyable and memorable. It was lovely strolling around her very pleasant neighbourhood street, which is only a few hundred metres from the bustling strip of Melrose avenue, with all of its fantastic shops, boutiques and nightlife within walking distance, or a short cab/LYFT/Uber ride away.  Location wise, it couldn’t have been more perfect for me.(I recommend taking a car to nearby Urth café for some of LA’s best food, celebrity spotting and coffee, The Grove shopping mall, or a walk to nearby Canters for Matza Ball soup! There are also some great vintage clothing stores very close by on Melrose ave, i.e., Wasteland, American Vintage, or Old School on Fairfax Ave!).Linda’s apartment is GORGEOUS too - the photos don’t really do it justice.  The place is homely and spacious, with an‘old Hollywood’ vibe that will charm your socks off.  I felt really at home here and found myself looking forward to coming home at the end of the day.  Plus Linda is super easy to chat to and get along with, so it felt like staying with an old friend.My room was beautiful, immaculate, big, and had a SUPER comfortable bed and pillows. No complaints there! There is a big chest of drawers and walk in wardrobe where you can store all of your things.  Linda also ensured I had a beautiful array of skincare and toiletry samples, as well as fresh towels and linen at my disposal.  (I struggled greatly with jetlag for a few days when I arrived from Australia, and Linda was very sweet, also giving me vitamin supplements to assist with my time zone issues!). The room has a good amount of natural light, and is right next to the bathroom too, which was handy. Bathroom was super cute! The only thing I will say is that adjusting the hand-held shower took a bit of getting used to, but having said that it was perfectly adequate. It wasn’t something I even thought to ask Linda about so I’m sure it was probably just that I wasn’t using it properly!Next time I visit LA, will definitely be back to visit and stay here!! That is, if Linda will have me and her place doesn’t become a hot ticket for West Hollywood AIRBNB! Highly recommended apartment, with brilliant host!Jess",en
1633204,8229666,2013-10-21,9166952,Michael,"My 13-year old and I stayed at Linda's for two weeks while my son was working on a film.Her house is very comfortable and is very conveniently located to just about anywhere in LA, especially the film and TV studios. And you couldn't ask for a safer, more pleasant neighborhood. I had no worries letting my kid skateboard down to The Grove or over to Melrose on his own. Linda was very welcoming and very accommodating and she did a great job of helping me keep my teenager entertained in between shoots and auditions (which is no easy feat). She was also very patient and understanding when AirBNB had trouble processing my payment the day we were scheduled to arrive.The only negative about our stay was the next door neighbor who did everything at full volume, well into the night. But, I guess, you're going to run into those kinds of things in an urban setting.All told, I highly recommend Linda's place for anyone who wants to be around the Beverly Hills/Hollywood area for business or vacation.",en

You'll have your own room in their apartment. The room is very spacious with nice furniture (big bed, walk-in closet and the room even has an office table – great if you need to get some work done during your trip) What's also really cool about this Airbnb is the location – it's in walking distance to some of the best stuff in Los Angeles – comedy clubs, shopping, restaurants, bars and supermarkets – so if you don't have a car during your trip this is the perfect location in my opinion.

I instantly felt home in their lovely house and in the spacious, well decorated room they provided me with. I stayed with them for over a month, and it is by far the best Airbnb experience I’ve had (and I’ve had many). They are so friendly, caring, interesting and helpful. They always made sure that I was doing well and that I wasn’t missing anything (this is so important in terms of feeling safe and comfortable being a foreigner in a new city) - but at the same time they were very respectful to my privacy, and didn’t interfere or interrupted me in any way. I never had any issues during my stay!They make sure that everything runs smooth. Everything like laundry, sharing the bathroom, kitchen etc. etc. They take your need, as a guest, into account and even when I got a friend visiting me they were open, welcoming and friendly towards him as well, and even helped us out with stuff to do.The room is great, located right next to the bathroom, it’s private, spacious, well decorated and with all the things you need: Tv, comfortable bed, desk, comfortable chair, lots of drawers, shelf’s and even a small walk in closet. It’s silent and dark at night, which makes sleeping easy and good! This is what Airbnb is (or should be) about. Meeting nice people and their culture, and I am so grateful that I ended up staying at Linda and Aaron’s place. So I’m happy to have gotten these new two friends - and will definitely stay there again (in case I didn’t make that clear in the text above) ;)Thanks Linda and Aaron!

They made a little Australian girl feel very at home. The home is exceptionally well maintained with a lovely rustic feel.

We stayed for two weeks and spent our time hiking, at the beach and visiting the many architectural works in Pacific Palisades, Santa Monica and Venice. During this time, he made us part of his life, even introduced us to meditation and gave us many rides when our destinations overlapped. 'Come as a guest and go as a friend' he jokingly said, but there is some truth in that! His place is perfectly located, in walking distance from both the village and the beach, and very welcoming, with always some music playing.

The place is clean and exactly as pictured in the photographs with access to a CVS and a Ralph's right across the street if you happen to be missing any amenities. If you're feeling lazy, it's also within walking distance of some tasty restaurants nearby.While my contact with Grover was limited to the first few initial e-mails, he made sure to coordinate with me about check-in and check-out accordingly, either through e-mail or with a greeter who met me with me on the day of check in to give me a tour and answer any questions and again on check out to touch base with me on my stay.My only ""gripe"" would be that I wish there'd been a TV to pass the time for an hour or two when you just need a little down time from being out and about, but it's a small one. But then again, I was pretty busy this trip and didn't have much time for TV, anyway, so not really a gripe. Would definitely stay here again.",en

It was the perfect size for a gal on her own (as well as for a couple), great kitchen, a bath and small balcony for fresh air. I felt very safe & comfortable. Probably the only downside was no TV which would have been good - normally I wouldn't care if I wasn't there much but I was home a lot working! Starfish Sushi downstairs is fantastic I ate there many times, and there's a great supermarket across the road. I actually wanted to extend but unfortunately it wasn't available after my booking.

He claimed he couldn’t reach the owner for approval at the time and encouraged us to contact Airbnb to resolve the matter. We left the property and did just that. Me and my guests felt discriminated and profiled as the host kept emphasizing they had experienced several damages with guests in the past. I assured him this wouldn’t be the case but we still couldn’t come to a solution so we were forced to book hotel rooms in the middle of the night and incur last minute expenses due to this matter. The host refused to cancel the booking and instead felt it was easier to charge us for the full amount even though we never occupied the property. He could have cancelled immediately and re-listed but he chose to keep our funds forthe entire stay and we never stayed at his property. After the fact I reached out to him to discuss the matter in a civil way, and he heard my voice and immediately hung up on me and refused to speak with me. Airbnb tried reaching out to him several times to resolve and every time they reached out he refused to honor us a refund for the booking. I have been using Airbnb for years and have never experienced anything like this. This whole situation has been extremely stressful and the host has zero sympathy or concern to resolve the matter. Please keep this in mind when booking the property. If anything goes wrong, the host will not work with you to resolve. He’ll just discard you and collect your funds with no regard.",en

The house itself is charming and adorable, and was just the right size for my family (two adults, a baby, and a dog, with the occasional visit from another friend or family member). The house is beautifully appointed -- with fun colors, bright prints, and cool photographs throughout. It makes the house feel super warm and bright. We also loved the small front/side yard area -- it was a good size lawn for playing with our dog, and we spent a lot of time on the front porch watching people go by on the street. Has a couple of amazing tall palm trees too so it really has that LA feel. The location is ideal if you are wanting to stay in Silver Lake/Echo Park. It is basically right in the middle of the two neighborhoods, and easy to walk to a lot of good restaurants and shops on Sunset, or drive a little farther to other spots. We also walked to Echo Park Lake many times - a fast walk to a cute and serene little park. It's a very fast drive (or a longer walk) also to the Silver Lake Reservoir. The neighborhood is cute, friendly, and safe, and we spent a few afternoons just walking around looking at all the cool cottages and their gardens.Tnah and Mario seem to have anticipated everything in terms of things guests might need while staying there. It has all the things you might want to use while you are there (in the kitchen, bathroom, extra linens, etc.). In general, the house is stocked as though someone lives there for real, but without feeling like you are living with someone else's stuff (if that makes sense). Much of the stuff (like linens, plates, etc.) also high quality so you don't feel like you are  having to make with crappy, cheapo ""vacation rental"" stuff.Tnah and Mario were delightful and thoughtful hosts. Tnah also went above and beyond to accommodate our family specifically. We brought our newborn baby, and Tnah provided a little bassinet for him to sleep in, and left a basket of goodies that were specially picked out for a new mom and baby. So sweet! They were also very responsive with the one or two very small issues we had. Tnah stopped by the property a couple of times to check the mail, etc., and was always very respectful of our space and time when doing so. I highly recommend staying at this cottage, particularly if you are a small family, a couple, or a single person. Just perfect!",en

This is an AWESOME house -- a perfectly charming bungalow, airy, well-located, extremely comfortable. My husband and I stayed here for a week while we were moving my daughter out of her Pomona college dorm. We also have a son and other friends who live in Silverlake and Echo Park and the house was fantastic for entertaining small groups, eating inside at the large dining table or relaxing on the deck outside. In fact, every morning we had coffee on the private and shady deck and every evening we spent some time outside on the porch or deck as well. The kitchen and bath were well stocked with everything needed or might need, from pots and pans to skin lotion and shampoo. Tnah and Mario were generous and thoughtful enough to provide coffee, bread, fruit and other goodies for our arrival. We had a rental car and being able to pull up and park in the driveway within the gated yard was extremely convenient. We took walks on many days in the quiet, hilly neighborhood, over to Echo Park, to neighborhood restaurants and vintage clothing stores or coffee shops. Several options for excellent takeout food are almost literally around the corner. After a day at L.A. museums or on campus, we looked FORWARD to returning to relax at the house. (My daughter was THRILLED there was a washer and dryer in the house!) This is not a touristy part of L.A.. It's where locals live and relax. By the end of the week, we felt like we were part of the neighborhood and knew it well. Tnah made everything about the stay easy and was unfailingly polite in all our transactions.

I selected her space based on the central location in LA and her glowing reviews.  Diana was also very lovely to interact with.  Since we knew that we would be arriving very late due to our flight, Diana was very clear to give me written directions for the guest house and where to find the key.  The key was under the mat as expected, but unfortunately we could not get it to turn in the lock.  Seeing as it was almost 2am, I was unable to reach our host, but we eventually found a hotel with a vacancy in Westwood to stay for our first night in town.  The next morning, when Diana realized the trouble we had the night before, she went above and beyond to make up for it.  Offered to reimburse us for the first night and even brought us a bottle of wine and Winchell's cinnamon buns.  Once we checked in, we still were unable to get the key to work, so in consultation with Diana decided to leave the space unlocked for the remainder of our stay since the neighborhood is pretty safe.

Diana was even kind enough to set up a pack and play for our three month old. The pool was lovely and we enjoyed swimming almost every day we were there. Also, we were able to walk on quiet streets to great restaurants - something so special for LA! Diana and her family were welcoming and very hospitable. We highly recommend it!",en
1688283,414783986,2019-02-20,16735245,Dina,"I have to say this was one of my best Airbnb stays!!!! Diana is by far the friendliest host I have dealt with across many countries and continents!!! Super friendly, helpful, with great tips, and really went out of her way to help me out in so many ways. Hospitality at it's best; she really went out of her way to make me feel at home, warm, and even fed for breakfast!!!! The place is a gem, and although (as Diana herself states, it's not a new modern 5 star hotel) it may be a bit old, it is quaint, homey, and absolutely charming!!!!! The house and guesthouse are beautiful, and the neighborhood is super pretty and safe. the location is great and central to many places in Hollywood. Many nice restaurants and shops are a walking distance, although LA is not a walking city. But as much as the neighborhood and the place itself are charming, it's Diana that made all the difference. Super quick responses and super helpful and sweet. I highly recommend and would definitely stay here again in a heart beat!",en

Not only was Diana incredibly professional as a host, her place was extremely clean - if there was any problem, she was only a phone call away and would get things sorted out as soon as possible. Her guest house was very quiet and spacious, making my stay feel relaxing whenever I came back from a long day at work. The guest house is located in very safe residential area, with just a few blocks down from Melrose avenue. I would definitely stay here again, 100% recommend!",en

The street is quiet, plenty of parking, and the neighbors that we came in contact with were all super nice. Diana's house was amazingly decorated for Halloween and the whole neighborhood was really festive, so that was fun to see! The only thing I'd suggest is a couple pillows of a different thickness, as they were all the same. We had a great time at Diana's place and we would definitely stay here again!",en

So cute, so charming, small but spacious - great little surprises like the breakfast in the fridge (yogurt, fruit, butter, bagels, etc) and the best of all, the perfect greeter/host, Mr. Seymour Alexander, who took naps with us on the bed!  One thing I wasn't aware of is that this is a family home and you should expect kids (very polite and charming) playing just outside of the guest house. Not a problem at all for us, but someone wanting privacy and quiet may have an issue.  We would definitely recommend Diana's place to others  A+ !!",en

She told me exactly what to expect in that everything in the suite is a bit old, and not to high standards of a hotel or an updated Airbnb. I really appreciated this as I found it ""exactly as she stated in her messages to me.  There is a small, rustic kitchen and older style bathroom. It would be comfortable for a short period of time as you visit LA.  There are many towels and pillows to use.The area is wonderful, and the center of LA in terms of wonderful access to restaurants, LACMA, Farmers Market on 3rd and Fairfax, Beverly Hills, and Hollywood.

She showed us around and gave us the lowdown on how things worked, whilst sprinkling in interesting anecdotes about the house and some of the objects in it.Her passion for the place was palpable and instilled a confidence in me that we would be well taken care of.Beyond the uniqueness of the place, which is more than enough reason to stay here; it's the people from Miguel, who oversees the daily maintenance of the property, to Steve and Lori who made this one of the most positive experiences I’ve ever had.I highly recommend staying here, it's a once in a lifetime experience.~ Naomi and Danny",en

1691660,634070043,2020-07-02,48857643,Melissa,"We spent four days at the Houdini Estate as a way of escaping other people during the pandemic and having a change of scenery. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and we took walks throughout the day to enjoy the manicured gardens and water features. There are hikes too but we found them a little treacherous. Having the five acres to yourself is well worth the added cost of the visiting the estate. It feels like your private paradise.The house itself is very nice, with two large bedrooms (a smaller room with a queen, the larger room with a king that was weirdly short--my feet hung off the end and I'm only 5'8"") and a third bedroom with two twin beds and a sofa bed. The ""monkey room"" outside the house is a glass enclosed room (with available room dividers which can be used to partially but not fully block light) that can be set up with two twin beds--ideal for kids. The bathrooms were very nice, with lots of hot water and very good water pressure. The kitchen area is decently stocked and we made several full family meals which we ate at the large family table set up by the pool.We spent a lot of time in the pool and hot tub, both of which had on and off issues with heating but were worked out by the diligent property manager Lori. The pool area is beautiful: shaded by giant trees strung with bistro lights and Moroccan-style lanterns. There's an outdoor bed perfect for reading with a coffee or glass of wine.One thing guests should be aware of is that the nature of the Houdini Estate is that tourists will try to visit, thinking that it is a publicly accessible museum. While we were checking in, the gate was open and someone tried to come in. I was paranoid most of my visit that people would enter, and checked the gate often. Given that you should have the entire estate to yourself, be aware that tourists may try to enter if you leave the gate open.",en

Lori was very kind welcoming our dogs, being extraordinarily communicative while answering all of our questions. One important note to add after being on the property is that the house itself is much smaller than you would anticipate. There was enough room for 3 of us, but I could see the place getting crowded for larger parties. The pool area will be shaded for a good majority of the day so that could definitely be a plus depending on the person. We did have an instance of a group of tourists on the property during the day but they were very polite when asked to leave. Overall it was a very unique and great experience.",en

The pool area was my absolute favorite, so relaxing and peaceful.  We barely left the estate since we had pretty much everything there.  Perfect for a smaller group of friends or family gathering.  Ella was super accommodating during our stay as well and promptly addressed issues.   Will definitely go back!",en
